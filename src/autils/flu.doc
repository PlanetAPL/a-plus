0.  Description.

	The flu gadget provides a standard mechanism for navigating 
	directories and applying file operations on selected elements.

1.  Operation.

	_FILES is a list of files and directories in the directory _DIR
	which pass the test implied by _FILTERS.  This test is:  an entry
	in _DIR which is either a suffixless directory, or ends in a suffix
	which matches one of (>1Ø_FILTERS)/0Ø_FILTERS.

	A directory can be specified by typing it into _DIR.

	An empty directory is equal to "./".

	The flu gadget will recognize a domain prefix to _DIR; e.g., nyfid:./

	Pressing the _UP button (= "..") backs up one level.

	If a directory name ends in one of the filtered suffixes, then 
	reference to it causes _FILE to be assigned to that directory name.

	Assignment (or entry) to _FILE finds the corresponding row in _FILES.

	If a directory name does not end in any of the filtered suffixes, 
	then selecting it causes it to be appended to _DIR.

	Selecting a file in the list causes _FILE to be assigned.

2.  zûdefine cx

	cx = target context of file-looker-upper
	z = `cx._FLU

	Define a flu-gadget in the specified context.

3.  Variables

	cx._DIRû	Directory, bound to a `scalar
	cx._UPû		`button: back up one directory level

	cx._FINDû	1 (match initial substring) or 0 (exact match)

	cx._FILES:	Filtered file-list
	cx._DIRS:	Filtered directory-list
	cx._PANEû	`vpane containing _DIRS and _FILES

	cx._FILTERSû	`check or `radio of filename suffixes
	cx._FLUû	`layout containing the above

	cx._FILEû	referenced file
	cx._VIEW:	sys.readmat _DIR,_FILE
