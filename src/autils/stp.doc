0.  Description.

	STP is an interactive stop-setting tool.  Thanks to jfs	for 
        suggesting the idea.

1.  Operation.
	
	Get everything loaded you want to stop and inspect.

	$load stp
	show stp.define `foo

	$stop 1			ã set stop to "on"

	Selecting a row in the "Contexts" list causes the variables and
	dependencies in that context to be displayed in the "Variables" list.

	Selecting a row in the "Variables" list causes all callback attributes
	of the selected variable to be displayed in the "Attributes" list.
	
	Referring to an unindexed row in the "Variables" list causes the
	dependency-definition of that variable to be redefined with "^`STP"
	at the beginning (if it is a dependency, else no-op.)

	Referring to an indexed row causes the dependency-definition to be
	unstopped.

	Referring to an unindexed row in the "Attributes" list causes the
	callback on that attribute to be redefined with "^`STP" at the
	beginning, *OR* one of the STP stop-callbacks to be installed on
	that attribute if none was installed by the application.

	Referring to an indexed row in the "Attribues" list reverses the
	action described above.

2.  zûdefine cx

	cx = target context of stop-setting tool
	z = `cx._STP

3.  Variables

	_STOPPEDû	slotfiller of stopped variables

	_CXû		selected context
	_VARû		selected variable
	
	_CXSû		all the contexts
	_VARSû		all the variables in the selected context
	_ATTSû		all callback attributes in the selected variable

	_STPû		outer layout
	
4.  Restrictions

	STP controls `select callback on _CXS and _VARS
	STP controls `refer callback on _VARS and _ATTS

5.  Example

			$load s
			$load stp
			$stop 1

			aûÉ10
			show `a
			bûÉ10
			show `b

			rfa{s;c;v}:Õ'refer a'
			slb{s;c;v}:Õ'select b'

			`a has (`refer;rfa)
			`b has (`select;(slb;É10))

		Select root context.
		Select `a variable.
		Reference `refer attribute.
		Look at .rfa - stopped.
		Refer to a row in `a - stopped.
		û
		Reference `refer attribute.
		Look at .rfa - unstopped.
		Refer to a row in `a - not stopped.

		Pick a unusued callback attribute - e.g., `select of `a.
		Repeat the above sequence - internal STP stop function
			is used (stp.stop_scv{} or stp.stop_sdipcv{}.)

		Define:	.c:a«b
		Select root context.
		Refer to `c.
		Look at _def `.c - stopped.
		Use c - stopped.
		û
		Refer to `c.
		Look at _def `.c - unstopped.
		Use c - not stopped.
