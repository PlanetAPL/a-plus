A+ Script Browser
-----------------
Examples of Syntax;

  doc.main "./manydoc.a"

  doc.main {("./manydoc.";"./dio.+")}

(Argument is a list of script files; only files ending with .a & .+
are used in place of wild cards)

First a list of script files will be displayed.


Use refer event (Double click) to get list of functions in script files.

Double click on the displayed function list will cause function to 
display.

Once a function is displayed, its parents (ie: functions which contain
references to the current function) and its children (ie: functions
which are referred to in current function) are displayed. Any of 
 these can be double clicked to see its listing.

Grep searches for character string in the whole appln; displays list of fns.

Double clicking in the search text field will cause search for the 
string in the displayed function.

A function name typed into the func search field will cause that 
function to be displayed.

In the displayed text of a function, blue rows contain references
to other functions.

Red and green lines in children and parent list will help you
keep track of the path you took to reach the current function
listing.
     

Save & Load are not implemented.

Dependencies and one line functions without opening braces will not
be recognized. Really large applications can take a while to be
read in.
