0.  Description.

	The BFM gadget ("File Manager-B") is a modification by Mike
	Skaff of the AFM gadget, which is a modification of the pup
	utility written by daveh and modified by mkr.

1.  Operation.

	BFM is a window for selecting files in an application 
	directory under a "mode".

	The set of files to be selected from is determined by
	the three variables _USER, _APPL, and _SUFFIX:

		_DIR:'/u/',_USER,'/',_APPL

	_SUFFIX is a character string which is chopped from the
	end of any matching files.  E.g., if

		_SUFFIXû'orother.m'

	and if file is 
		
		somethingorother.m

	it will be displayed as 

		something

	There are three modes:  get, put, and drop.  A mode is
	selected via the radio box _MODES, or by setting the gadget
	variable _MODE to one of `get, `put, or `drop.  Either
	action causes a corresponding state-change in the companion
	variable.  E.g., setting _MODEû`put causes (`putØ_MODES) to
	become 1, and vice-versa.

	In "get" mode, the operator can enter a user name (_USER)
	and pick from the files displayed in _NAMES.  

	In "put" mode, the operator can enter a new file name (_NEW),
	but cannot change the user name from sys.getusername.

	In "drop" mode, the operator can neither enter a new file
	name nor change the user name from sys.getusername.

	The table _FILES contains three fields:  _NAMES, _DATES, and
	_TIMES.  By default, these are sorted down on _DATES and _TIMES.
	By setting _SORTû0, the table will be sorted up on _NAMES.

2.  zûdefine cx

	cx = target context of BFM
	z = `cx._BFM

	Define an BFM-gadget in the specified context.

3.  Variables

	_FONTû		Electric font variable
	_SORTû		1 (ç _DATES, _TIMES) or 0 (è_NAMES)

	_USERû		"username" (default = sys.getusername) 
	_FILEû		Selected file
	_APPLû		Application name
	_SUFFIXû	Invisible filename suffix
	
	_DIR:		Implied directory
	_FILESû		File table (depends on _DIR, _SUFFIX, _TRIGGER)
