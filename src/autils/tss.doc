0.  Description.

	TSS is a sort-and-select browser for T tables.

1.  Operation.

	Bring up TSS in a context.

	When a directory is specified (_DIRû'xyz'), either programmatically,
	or in response to the "Open" action, several steps occur:

	  1. The T context specified by _SOURCE is closed.

	  2. An attempt is made to t.open{} the directory _DIR into the 
	     context _SOURCE.

	  3. If successful, a view of _SOURCE is generated in the context 
	     _TARGET.

          4. t.table{} is applied to _TARGET.

          5. _TABLEû_TARGETÖ`_T_; i.e., the table is shown in TSS.



	Field selection ("projection") is made via an SST gadget.

	Field sorting is also done through SST, with _SORTû1.
nnn
	Views in _TARGET can be "fixed" through the _FIX toggle.

	Selections can be made against the table in _TARGET by entering
	selection criteria into the _CMD scalar.  Permitted forms have
	the following structure:

		Ê a monadic keyword followed by an expression
		Ê a keyword
		Ê an expression
		Ê blank

	Monadic eywords are:  only, also, not
	Niladic keywords are:  all

	A keyword alone is equivalent to the corresponding T function with
	a null right argument.  E.g., 

		only	ûý	_TARGET t.only () 	ûý 	all

	An expression alone is equivalent to t.only{} applied to that
	expression.  E.g.,
		
		a>10	ûý	_TARGET t.only 'a>10'

	A blank is a no-op.

	Summary:

		Ê Open:		t.open{} from the specified directory.
		Ê Close:	t.close{} the open table.
		Ê Order:	Select and order fields to view.
		Ê Sort:		Sort up and down on selected fields.

		Ê Fix:		Toggle t.fix{} on open table.

		Ê Command:	

		     Permitted forms:

			only <expression>
			also <expression>
			not <expression>
			<expression>
			only
			also
			not
			all
			<blank>
			
2.  zûdefine cx

	cx = target context of TSS tool.
	z = `cx._TSS

	Define TSS in the specified context.

3.  Variables

	_DIRû		T directory, or ()
	_SOURCEû	Context of source table
	_TARGETû	Context of target table	
	_DOû		0Ø_ACTION

	_ACTIONû	Actions
	_MSGû		Message scalar
	_CMDû		Command scalar
	_FIXû		Fix selection toggle
	_TABLEû		Layout
	_TSSû		Outer layout	

4.  Restrictions

	TSS controls:

5.  Example

		$load s
		$load t
		$load tss

		show tss.define `		ã define in root
