                                   Introduction 

All the tutorials are contained in:

    (Install_Directory)/doc/tutorials

By default the Install_Directory is /usr/local/aplus-fsf-x.xx 
(where x.xx is version.release)

i.e. /usr/local/aplus-fsf-4.22/doc/tutorials/GettingStarted

This set of tutorials deals primarily with the A+ language. However,
the first one, GettingStarted, is designed to do just what its name
says, to introduce you to the A+ application development system in
which you will work.

If you are relatively new to programming in A+ or APL, or if you are
rusty, go on to ScalarFunctions. If you are familiar with APL,
however, go on to SimpleArrays instead and look for the differences
between A+ and the APL dialects you know.

A+ uses the special APL character set, which requires special key
sequences for entry; see the keyboard layout diagrams in Chapter 2
and Appendix B of the A+ Reference Manual.

In addition to these tutorials, there are four subdirectories:

- one of files containing further examples (named examples);
- one containing tutorials for screen management and some material
  for examples, treating all classes except graphs (s.tutorials);
  start with s.tutorials/introduction;
- one containing a tutorial on the graph display class and a file of
  data for examples (graphs);
