    <meta name="description" content="A+ is a powerful and efficient programming
          language. It is freely available under the GNU General Public License.
          It embodies a rich set of functions and operators, a modern graphical
          user interface with many widgets and automatic synchronization of
          widgets and variables, asynchronous execution of functions associated
          with variables and events, dynamic loading of user compiled
          subroutines, and many other features. Execution is by a rather
          efficient interpreter. A+ was created at Morgan Stanley.
          Primarily used in a computationally-intensive business environment,
          many critical applications written in A+ have withstood the demands
          of real-world developers over many years. Being written in an
          interpreted language, A+ applications are easily ported, if not
          inherently portable due to application-specific platform dependencies.
          The A+ interpreter has proven to be straightforward to port among a
          disparate assortment of Unix platforms.

          This site is provided to help users get the most out of A+."/>
