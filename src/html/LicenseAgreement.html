<h3>A+ License Agreement<hr></h3>
<! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
This License Agreement states the conditions under which a Package may
be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the
users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a
more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.
<p>
Definitions:
<blockquote>
<p><ul>
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.
<p>
	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
<p>
	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.
<p>
	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.
<p>
	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people
	involved, and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it
	to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community
	at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
<p>
	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the
	item.  It also means that recipients of the item may
	redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
   the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
   that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
   associated disclaimers.
<p><li>
You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
   derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A
   Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
   Standard Version.
<p><li>
You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
   provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
   stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you
   do at least ONE of the following:
<p>
<ol type=a><li>
place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
      them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
      Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on
      a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the
      Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
      Version of the Package.
<p><li>
use the modified Package only within your corporation or
      organization.
<p><li>
rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
      with standard executables, which must also be provided, and
      provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable
      that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
<p><li>
make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
</ol>
<p><li>
You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code
   or.executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the
   following:
<p>
<ol type=a><li>
distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
      files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
      equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
<p><li>
accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
      the Package with your modifications.
<p><li>
give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
      document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
      together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
<p><li>
make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
</ol>
<p><li>
You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
   this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of
   this Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.
   However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other
   (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly
   commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
   advertise this Package as a product of your own.  You may embed
   this Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by
   linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation,
   provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is
   so embedded.
<p><li>
The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
   output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
   under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever
   generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated
   with this Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated
   with this Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of
   producing a binary executable image, then distribution of such an
   image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package
   nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4,
   provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a
   Standard Version of this Package.
<p><li>
C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
   languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
   emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
   Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
   equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines
   donot change the language in any way that would cause it to fail
   the regression tests for the language.
<p><li>
Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is
   always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded;
   that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's
   interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.
   Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
<p><li>
The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
   promote products derived from this software without specific prior
   written permission.
<p><li>
THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.  NO REPRESENTATION
    OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS MADE, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH
    RESPECT TO THE PACKAGE (OR THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY THE USE
    THEREOF), INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF ORIGINALITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY
    AND FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE
    RISK OF ANY USE YOU MAY MAKE OF THE PACKAGE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL
    MORGAN STANLEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
    PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR
    INABILITY TO USE THE PACKAGE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION,
    EVEN IF MORGAN STANLEY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE
    ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  SOME STATES DO NOT
    ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR LIABILITIES.  IN SUCH
    EVENT, MORGAN STANLEY'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO $10
    (TEN DOLLARS).
