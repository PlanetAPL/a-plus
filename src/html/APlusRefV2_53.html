<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">Parsing Rules for A+ Script Files</FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
A+ script<A NAME=2> files are parsed from top to bottom when loaded, and all unresolved
 names are assumed to be variables. For example, suppose the following two lines appear in
 a script, in this order:
<pre><font face=Kapl>f{x}:g Î x
g{y}:y,' '</font></pre>
<A NAME=3>When this script is loaded, the definition of the function
 <font face=Kapl>f</font> is parsed before that of <font face=Kapl>g</font>, and therefore
 <font face=Kapl>g</font> is assumed to be a (global) variable in the definition of
 <font face=Kapl>f</font>, and the symbol <font face=Kapl>Î</font> is taken to be the
 dyadic primitive. Then the definition of <font face=Kapl>g</font> is parsed and it is
 determined that <font face=Kapl>g</font> is a function. When <font face=Kapl>f</font> is
 evaluated, a type error results because the dyadic primitive <font face=Kapl>Î</font> is
 passed a function as a left argument.
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     f`abc
 Î: type
*     ©x        ã </font>Inquire about <font face=Kapl>x
 `sym           ã </font>It's a symbol.<font face=Kapl>
*     ©{g}
 `func          ã </font>But <font face=Kapl>g</font> is a function.<font face=Kapl>
*     ý</font></pre>
<A NAME=4>This problem could have avoided by defining <font face=Kapl>g</font> before
 <font face=Kapl>f</font>. In general, however, and certainly in large applications, it is
 not reasonable (and sometimes not possible) to maintain scripts so that functions are
 always defined before they used. The problem could also be avoided by using the alternate
 function-call syntax; in the above example:
<pre><font face=Kapl>     f{x}:g{Î x}</font></pre>
Now the A+ process can tell from the syntax that <font face=Kapl>g</font> is a monadic
 function, whether or not it has been defined. This syntax is unambiguous, whereas that
 of<font face=Kapl> f </font>in the original definition is ambiguous.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expression <A NAME=5>Continuation in
 Entry and Function Definition</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=16>When an expression, expression group, or function definition is entered on
 several lines in an A+ session, A+ supplies stars at the left of each line to indicate
 the depth of punctuation. In general, these stars are used to indicate the total number of
 open quotation marks (at most one), braces, and parentheses, and an expression or function
 definition remains open until they are closed. Brackets are not treated in this way,
 however, and in the absence of an open quote, brace, or parenthesis a line or series of
 lines with an open bracket elicits an error message. Pressing the <b>Enter</b> key while
 inside a quotation mark inserts a newline character in the quoted string, but pressing
 <b>Linefeed</b> causes A+ to ignore all entries on the current line that follow the open
 quote (including the <b>Linefeed</b> itself).<P>
If any brackets, braces, or parentheses are open when a function definition is closed, a
 token error is reported and the definition does not take effect. At the time when such
 punctuation becomes isolated (e.g., after the closing parenthesis for the bracket
 in<font face=Kapl> (3 4;bûd[1;3)</font>),&nbsp; a message "Mismatched parentheses" (no
 matter what the punctuation - brackets, braces, or parentheses!) appears at the bottom of
 the screen in Emacs.<P>
The expressions <A NAME=19><font face=Kapl>case(target)</font> and
 <font face=Kapl>if(condition)</font> and <font face=Kapl>while(condition)</font> are each
 followed by an expression or expression group in actual usage, but they are considered by
 the parser to be complete (with a Null as the following expression) when they are followed
 by the <b>Enter</b>, so don't break a line there unless you have something else holding
 the expression open, and don't immediately follow an <font face=Kapl>if(condition)</font>
 with an <font face=Kapl>else</font> with the intention of returning and filling in the
 <font face=Kapl>if</font> action unless you are very sure you won't forget.<P>
Function definition has one continuation peculiar to itself: if the <b>Enter</b> key is
 pressed immediately after the colon following the function header, the function definition
 remains open, for just one more line (unless that line produces a continuation). If
 anything, however, even just a space, is entered after the colon, then there is no implied
 continuation. In particular, if only spaces are entered after the colon, a parse error is
 reported and the opening of the definition has no effect.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expression <A NAME=21>Groups for Immediate
 Execution</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
In immediate execution, when there is no pending punctuation or function definition,
 several
 expressions can be entered on one line, separated by semicolons. They will be treated as
 an expression group. The next section discusses the implications of this treatment for
 display.<P>
One useful aspect of this treatment is that one can bring into the workspace for immediate
 execution a script line which is only part of an expression group. Putting it another way,
 an expression group or part thereof can be brought in and executed immediately as long as
 its punctuation is matching - as long as it contains either both or neither of the group's
 enclosing braces.<P>
An expression in braces, with no semicolon, also constitutes an expression group.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING613>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate <A NAME=23>Execution
 Display</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
When an expression or expression group is entered for execution, by pressing the
 <b>Enter</b> key, an error message may be displayed. If it is not, then the result is
 displayed, except that it is not displayed for an expression whose last operation is
 Assign.<P>
The display of the Null is indistinguishable from no display, so in effect the displaying
 of the result can be suppressed for an expression or expression group by appending a
 semicolon to it, making the expression a courtesy expression group. Likewise, display can
 be forced for an expression alone on a line, even when it ends with Assign, by preceding
 the expression with a semicolon. (Preceding such an assignment in immediate execution by a
 <font face=Kapl>Õ</font>, thus applying Print to it, causes it to be displayed twice, once
 by Print and once as the default display of an expression whose last function is not
 Assign.)<P>
For function and dependency definitions, there is no additional display: the entered
 definitions, together with the A+ prompts indicating depth of punctuation, are the entire
 displayed response.

<A NAME=HEADING614>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default <A NAME=26>Display of Arrays</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
Arrays are listed in ravel order. Simple character arrays start at the left margin. Simple
 numeric arrays are indented one space. Numbers that are in columns in the display are
 aligned. Simple vectors are displayed horizontally. Simple arrays of higher rank are
 displayed with vertical columns, horizontal rows, one skipped line between cells of rank
 2, an extra skipped line between cells of rank 3, and so on. For example:
<pre><font face=Kapl>     É2 2 2 6
  0  1  2  3  4  5
  6  7  8  9 10 11

 12 13 14 15 16 17
 18 19 20 21 22 23


 24 25 26 27 28 29
 30 31 32 33 34 35

 36 37 38 39 40 41
 42 43 44 45 46 47</font></pre>
A <font face=Kapl>&lt;</font> is
 used for a function scalar, since it must always be shown as an enclosed function
 expression. Furthermore, vectors of function scalars are displayed vertically. For
 example:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     &lt;{+},&lt;{-},&lt;{=}
&lt;  +         ã </font>Vector displayed vertically, with <font face=Kapl>&lt;</font> showing enclosure of the<font face=Kapl>
&lt;  -         ã </font>function expressions, to make simple, depth-0 function scalars.<font face=Kapl>
&lt;  =</font></pre>
<p>
Each nested component of a nested array begins on a new line. A
 <font face=Kapl>&lt;</font> character is
 used to indicate the beginning of an enclosed object. It is also used sometimes to
 indicate
 a symbol, as shown above, but it is not so used in this manual except for that example.
 For instance:
<pre><font face=Kapl>     (1 2 3; 2 2Ò25; (3 4;É2 3;&lt;&lt;100))
&lt;  1 2 3
&lt;  25 25
   25 25
&lt; &lt;  3 4
  &lt;  0 1 2
     3 4 5
  &lt; &lt; &lt;  100
</font></pre>

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuming <A NAME=28>Execution</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>When execution of a expression or function has been suspended because of an
 error or an interruption, expressions can be entered for immediate execution. (The
 expressions may include calls of other functions and may lead to suspensions of their
 own.)  Values, shapes, types, etc. of both global variables and ones local to the
 suspended function may be examined and changed. The arguments on the stack
 (<font face=Kapl>&amp;0 &amp;1 ...</font>) can also be examined and changed. (Changing
 variables which were arguments to the suspended function has no effect on the stacked
 arguments.)<P>
To resume execution of the suspended function, with the workspace size increased if
 necessary, enter<br>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;û</font><br>
alone on a line.<P>
To <A NAME=31>abandon execution, and execution of any pendent function that is waiting on
 this suspended function, enter either<br>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ý</font><br>
or<br>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$</font><br>
alone on a line.
<p>
To abandon execution of the last <i>n</i> suspended functions, enter<br>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$reset&nbsp;</font><i>n</i><br>
and to abandon execution of all suspended functions, enter just<br>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$reset</font><br>
See the <a href="APlusRefV2_15.html#129">Reset</a> command.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA"><A NAME=30>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Form of Error and Other
 Messages</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
Error reports are prefixed by a comment symbol and the type of report in
 brackets, to make it more explicit and also to prevent it from spoiling a part of a log
 that would otherwise be usable as a script:
<pre><font face=Kapl>     3+0ß5-5
ã[error]  ß: domain</font></pre>
<pre><font face=Kapl>ã[error]  segv</font></pre>
and
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>ã PKG: 1: Storing .two     ã </font>See the <a href="APlusRefV2_56p.html#HEADINGp69">package example.</a></pre>
There are, however, some error messages that are not in this form, none of them strictly
A+ error messages. Among them are
<pre><font face=Kapl>filename: No such file or directory
not an `a object</font></pre>
and a great many messages from adap.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING616>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA"><A NAME=33>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contexts</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
To help in avoiding name conflicts, A+ provides contexts. A context provides a level of
 qualification for global names. The fully qualified form of any global name is
 <i>c</i>.<i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> is the unqualified name of the object and <i>c</i> is
 the context for that name. Every name is accessible from every context by the use of its
 fully qualified form.<P>
<A NAME=39>The workspace always has one current context. Initially, at the beginning of an
 A+ session, it is the <i>root</i> context, whose name is the empty string. So
 <font face=Kapl>.y</font> is the form that a fully qualified name takes in this context.
 Such a name always refers to the root context. The current context can be changed
 by<font face=Kapl>&nbsp; $cx&nbsp;cxt&nbsp; </font>as discussed for the
 <A HREF="APlusRefV2_15.html#23">Context command</A>; by
 convention,<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;$cx&nbsp;.&nbsp; </font>is used to change
 the current context to the root context - i.e., the context name is given as a period. In
 an expression entered for immediate execution, any unqualified name, no matter what its
 use - reference, specification, call, definition -, is understood to be implicitly
 qualified by the current context. Thus unqualified names can be used for objects whose
 full names are qualified by the current context.<P>
A <A NAME=44>function also has a context. If a fully qualified name was used for it in its
 definition, then the context is the one referred to in that name; otherwise, the
 function's context is the one that was current when it was defined (and indeed, its fully
 qualified name includes the name of that current context). All unqualified global names
 within a function are implicitly qualified by the function's context; the context in which
 the function is executed is irrelevant to their interpretation.  When a function is
 suspended, the context for immediate execution is the function's context. If the context
 is changed while a function is suspended, resumption of execution will automatically
 change the context back. Completion of execution returns the context to what it was when
 the function was called.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING617>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local and Global Names</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>To avoid clutter in the workspace and to reduce the possibility of name
 conflict, a name can be local - i.e., have meaning only in the function in which it occurs
 and disappear when execution of that function is complete. Such a name must be
 unqualified, and it is made local by an Assignment within the function in which only the
 name appears to the left of the arrow. All qualified names are global. See
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_16.html#2">Scope of Names</A>".<P>
A function can see only global names and its own local names. A user can see only global
 names and the local names of the latest suspended function (and not pendent ones).
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING618>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visible Use of a Name</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
A <A NAME=47>visible use of a name occurs when the name appears in A+ code directly, and
 not in a character string or a symbol. A use that is not visible is an implicit reference,
 which occurs through the employment of <A HREF="APlusRefV2_8.html#105">Execute</A>
 (<font face=Kapl>â</font>) or <A HREF="APlusRefV2_8.html#331">Value</A>
 (<font face=Kapl>%</font>). This distinction is important for dependencies, which are
 invalidated only by visible uses of names (cf.
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_57.html#164">Dependencies</A>", especially
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_17.html#8">Evaluation</A>" and
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_17.html#19">Dependencies Defined</A>").
