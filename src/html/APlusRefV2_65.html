<A NAME=2>Importing and exporting data:
 <font face=Kapl>sys.exp</font>
 is monadic and takes any A+ data object as its argument, returning an encoded character
 vector. <font face=Kapl>sys.imp</font> is also monadic and takes any result of
 <font face=Kapl>sys.exp</font> as its argument and returns the decoded data object as its
 result. Results of <font face=Kapl>sys.exp</font> are convenient for writing data to files
 or sending it to another Unix process.
<P>
<A NAME=3>Bus error: The A+ interpreter attempted to read from an address outside your
 area, or an attempt was made to read or write without regard to address alignment. If
 a<font face=Kapl> ã[error] : bus </font>(or a<font face=Kapl>&nbsp; : bus</font>)&nbsp;
 error occurs, the application should be restarted.
 If the error can be recreated, please contact us to look into it.
 See <a href="APlusRefV2_13.html#8"><font face=Kapl>`busexit</font></a>.
<P>
<A NAME=4>Segv error: The A+ interpreter attempted to write in an address outside your
 area. If a<font face=Kapl> ã[error] : segv </font>(or a<font face=Kapl>&nbsp; :
 segv</font>)&nbsp;error occurs, the application should also be restarted,
 just as for a bus error, and the error reported to the A+ development group, email id
 aplusdev. See <a href="APlusRefV2_13.html#8"><font face=Kapl>`busexit</font></a>.<P>
<A NAME=5>Process `a' illegal instruction:
 This message is most commonly caused by a bus or segv error,
 and indicates that you continued your session after a bus or segv error occurred.
 The application should be restarted and,
 if you didn't continue after a bus or segv error,
 please contact us so that we can look into it.
<P>
If an error is signalled by a program, as opposed to occurring in a primitive function or
 operator, the stack variables are not likely to be helpful. In particular, if an error is
 signalled from within adap, the stack variables will be meaningless, since there is no
 point in adap to suspend at.<P>
<A NAME=8>The system context function, <font face=Kapl>sys.getdomainname{}</font>, if
 successfully executed, returns a character vector containing the NIS domain name of the
 current host; otherwise, it returns Null.
