<A NAME=2>The machines on which A+ is run represent numbers in binary (base 2), for efficient storage and computation.  A+ (via C) represents integers in 32 bits (binary digits) and floating-point numbers in 64.  The largest integer representable in this way is </font><font face=Kapl>(2*31)-1</font> and the smallest is <font face=Kapl>¢2*31</font> (-2147483648);  the greatest magnitude representable as a floating-point number is approximately <font face=Kapl>1.7977e+308</font>.
<P>
In display and print, of course, A+ represents numbers in decimal.  People tend to think in decimal and their input is usually decimal.  Numbers like .1 and .01 seem exactly representable intrinsically (as they <i>are</i> in decimal), but, in fact, these numbers cannot be exactly represented in binary, and decimal to binary and binary to decimal conversions are one source of imprecision.
<P>
Another source of imprecision is the necessarily limited number of digits that can be used to represent a number.  One effect of this limitation is inexactitude, which can be seen in simple examples:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     123456789123456789 - 123456789123456788
 0
     12345678912345679 - 12345678912345678
 2
     .123456789123456789 - .123456789123456788
 0
<p>
</font>and yet:<font face=Kapl>
<p>
     .000000000000000001
 1e-18</font></pre>
Another effect of this limitation is, of course, that there are numbers that are simply too large to be numerically represented in A+ at all, such as <font face=Kapl>10*1234</font>.<P>
Results can only be <i>meaningfully</i> displayed out to a maximum of 16 digits. Any digits shown beyond the 16th digit are invalid. For example, the actual value of pi begins with 3.141592653589793238; but if we set $pp to 20 (a value that is beyond the meaningful range), <font face=Kapl>o1</font> will return 3.141592653589793116. Only the first 16 digits are correct.<p>
To allow for slight imprecisions in the representation of numbers by considering numbers to be equal when they are very close to equal, the concept of a <i>comparison tolerance</i> is used.  To allow computations to continue when some of the numbers involved have become too large to be represented, a special representation, <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>, has been introduced, together with its negative, <font face=Kapl>¢Inf</font>.

<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">Comparison <A NAME=3>Tolerance </FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
Comparison tolerance cannot be set; it is fixed at <font face=Kapl>1e-13</font>.<P>
It is used in both conversion of floating-point numbers to integers and explicit comparisons, as in Equal to, Match, and Find.<P>
The fundamental notion is to put a band around one of the comparands and see whether the other comparand falls within that band.  Consider <font face=Kapl>x=y</font>, for instance.  Roughly speaking, the equality holds if <font face=Kapl>x</font> is within (without tolerance, of course) the interval from <font face=Kapl>y«1-1e-13</font> to <font face=Kapl>y«1+1e-13</font>. More precisely, the difference between the comparands must be less (without tolerance) than the tolerance times the smaller of them in absolute value: <font face=Kapl>|x-y</font> must be less than <font face=Kapl>1e-13«(|x)Ä|y</font>.  Because multiplication is involved, only zero is equal to zero within the comparison tolerance.<P>
Comparison tolerance applies only to floating-point comparisons.  The largest magnitude that can be represented in A+ in integer type is <font face=Kapl>2*31</font>, which is <font face=Kapl>|¢2*31</font>.  That times the tolerance, i.e., <font face=Kapl>1e-13«2*31</font>, is only about 0.0002.  Thus the tolerance could not have any effect on comparisons between two integers.<P>
When examining the effect, or apparent effect, of comparison tolerance, you must take into account the printing precision (which may make two unequal numbers look equal) and the fact that the Equal to function itself uses comparison tolerance.  As an intolerant check for equality of <font face=Kapl>a</font> and <font face=Kapl>b</font>, you can use <font face=Kapl>0=a-b</font>.<P>
Consider numbers shown in an example above, where their difference was approximated as 2:<P>
<pre>
<font face=Kapl>     12345678912345679 = 12345678912345678<BR> 1</font>
</pre>
Clearly, Equal to uses comparison tolerance to arrive at the result: A+ disregards the insignificant (and in fact inexact) difference it finds between them.  But doesn't comparison tolerance apply only to floating-point numbers?  Yes, but there are several ways to enter numbers for representation in floating point: e.g., with a decimal point (<font face=Kapl>99.</font> or <font face=Kapl>3.14</font>, for instance), in exponential notation (<font face=Kapl>6.023e-23</font>), and with too many digits for it to be represented internally as an integer (<font face=Kapl>12345678912345679</font>).  Each number entered is converted to its internal representation before anything else is done with it.<P>
Comparison tolerance is used in:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Ceiling, Floor, and Residue;
<LI>Equal to, Greater than, Greater than or Equal to, Less than, Less than or Equal to, and Not equal to;
<LI>Find, Match, and Member;
</UL>
and no other functions.<P>
<A NAME=6>When two floating-point numbers are equal within the comparison tolerance, they are called <i>tolerably equal</i>.  This term is also used in a more general way, to mean equal within the tolerance for floating-point numbers and strictly equal where no floating-point number is involved.<P>
Note that the term <i>restricted whole number</i>,
 as discussed <A HREF="APlusRefV2_2.html#12">above</A>
 and in "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_4.html#77">Restricted Whole Numbers</A>",
 involves even more toleration,
 since it includes numbers whose absolute value
 is less than <font face=Kapl>1e-13</font>,
 whereas zero is not tolerably equal to any nonzero number.

<blockquote>
A+ uses <font face=Kapl>Inf</font> to denote positive numbers too large for it to represent, and <font face=Kapl>¢Inf</font> for negative numbers whose magnitude is too great to be represented.  <font face=Kapl>Inf</font> is tantamount to infinity.  You can enter these notations directly; also, if you enter, say, <font face=Kapl>1e309</font>, it will be shown and stored as <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>.<P>
Instead of a domain error, division by zero of a positive number yields <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>, and of a negative number, <font face=Kapl>¢Inf</font>.  The Min reduction of an empty vector yields <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>, and the Max reduction yields <font face=Kapl>¢Inf</font>.  And so on.<P>
When either of these values is an argument to a function, most of what you might expect happens: <font face=Kapl>-¢Inf</font> is <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>, and <font face=Kapl>«Inf</font> is 1, and <font face=Kapl>4ÄInf</font> is 4.  <P>
Any operation which heightens <font face=Kapl>Inf</font> or <font face=Kapl>¢Inf</font> produces it as its result: <font face=Kapl>10«Inf</font> is <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>, and <font face=Kapl>¢Inf-100</font> is <font face=Kapl>¢Inf</font>, and <font face=Kapl>Inf+Inf</font> is <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>, and so forth.  Operations involving representable numbers that tend to lessen <font face=Kapl>Inf</font> or <font face=Kapl>¢Inf</font> are also accepted, however, so that, for example, <font face=Kapl>Inf-1e99</font> is <font face=Kapl>Inf</font>.  (Indeed, although they are unlikely to occur, <font face=Kapl>1e309ß1e308</font> is <font face=Kapl>Inf</font> and <font face=Kapl>1e308ß1e309</font> is 0, because <font face=Kapl>1e309</font> is converted to <font face=Kapl>Inf</font> upon input, before the division, and <font face=Kapl>1e308</font> is representable.)<P>
Domain errors result from indeterminate expressions like <font face=Kapl>Inf-Inf</font> and <font face=Kapl>0«Inf</font>, as well as <font face=Kapl>0ß0</font>.
