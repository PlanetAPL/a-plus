<A NAME=2>As described in earlier chapters, the <A HREF="APlusRefV2_14.html#115">Load</A>
 and <A HREF="APlusRefV2_14.html#119">Load and Remove</A> system functions and the
 <A HREF="APlusRefV2_15.html#92">Load</A> and <A HREF="APlusRefV2_15.html#100">Load and
 Remove</A> commands deal with script files, loading such a file into the active workspace
 by interpreting every one of its lines, starting at the top, essentially as if the lines
 had been entered directly in the active workspace. The difference is that after a file is
 loaded, the current context and the current directory are the same as they were when the
 Load command or function was initiated: each is automatically restored if it was changed
 during execution of the lines of the file. See "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_53.html#0">Workspaces
 and Scripts</A>" for more details concerning this kind of file.

<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">Mapped <A NAME=4>Files </FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>Data files in A+ are called <i>mapped files</i>.<p>
<p>
From the viewpoint of the A+ primitive functions, a mapped file is (for the most part) an
 ordinary array when accessed through an associated variable. A mapped file can always be
 referenced and (if opened for writing) selectively assigned (see
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_8.html#257">Selective Assignment</A>") as if it were an ordinary
 array.<p>
<A NAME=5>
Ordinary (as opposed to selective) Assignment conveys not only value (including shape) but
 also mapping status to its target.&nbsp; In particular, a target that is mapped will
 remain so if and only if the righthand side of the Assignment is mapped (see bullet items
 below);&nbsp; otherwise, it will become an ordinary array.&nbsp; Also, since passing
 arguments and results acts like ordinary specification, if a function is called with a
 mapped file as an argument, that (local variable) argument in the function will be mapped,
 and if the result of the last expression executed in a function is mapped, so is its
 result.

<ul>
<li>Primitive functions whose results for mapped arguments are always identical in value
 and <i>mapped</i>:
<br>
Left (<font face=Kapl>Ý</font>),&nbsp;
 Print (<font face=Kapl>Õ</font>),&nbsp;
 Result (<font face=Kapl>û</font> with no left argument),&nbsp;
 Stop (<font face=Kapl>^</font>).
<p>
<li>Primitive functions whose results for mapped arguments are perhaps not identical but
 always <i>mapped</i>:
<br>
Disclose (<font face=Kapl>&gt;</font>),&nbsp;
 Enclose (<font face=Kapl>&lt;</font>),&nbsp;
 Raze (<font face=Kapl>Ø</font>).
<p>
<li>Primitive functions whose results for mapped arguments are always identical in value
 but <i>unmapped</i>:
<br>
Right (<font face=Kapl>Û</font>),&nbsp;
 Identity (<font face=Kapl>+</font>).
<p>
<li>Primitive functions plus arguments whose results for mapped arguments are identical
 and <i>mapped</i>:
<br>
<font face=Kapl>m[] &nbsp;&nbsp;
 ()#m &nbsp;&nbsp;
 ()Øm &nbsp;&nbsp;
 (É0)Øm</font>
<p>
<li>Primitive functions plus arguments whose results for mapped arguments are identical
 and <i>unmapped</i>:
<br>
<font face=Kapl>m[;] &nbsp;&nbsp;
 (;)#m &nbsp;&nbsp;
 1/m &nbsp;&nbsp;
 (©m)©m &nbsp;&nbsp;
 (©m)©®m</font>
</ul>

A+ provides a special syntax that is particularly useful for updating all elements of a
 mapped file:<BR>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a[]ûb</font><br>
and a special syntax that is particularly useful for appending new items to a mapped
 file:<BR>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a[,]ûb</font>
<p>
Again, see Selective Assignment for definitions of these expressions. Appending items to a
 mapped file with the latter special sequence is permitted only when enough space already
 has been allocated for the new items. If not enough space has been allocated, a maxitems
</td></tr></table> error is reported. Such allocation is accomplished with
 <font face=Kapl>_items</font> ("<A HREF="APlusRefV2_14.html#108">Items of a Mapped
 File</A>"). After allocation, the file must be
 remapped.<p>
On AIX, the workspace size can't be enlarged when there is a file mapped
 (<font face=Kapl>Ò1&nbsp;0Ø_dbg{`display;`beam} </font>is nonzero), because A+ requires
 that the entire workspace be contiguous and AIX  requires that all space be taken from one
 end of the address space; thus, the mapped file blocks workspace enlargement.<P>
When one mapped file is created from another, by ordinary Assignment, the new mapped file
 has only enough space to contain the data;  the value of
 <font face=Kapl>_items{¢1;}</font> for the old file is not carried over to the new
 file.<A NAME=APlusRefV2_FootNote_955 HREF=APlusRefV2_FootNote_955.html><b><sup>1</sup></b></A><P>
<A NAME=11>Mapped files can be shared by different A+ processes, and all A+ processes on
 the same machine will immediately see any updates by other A+ processes on that same
 machine. A+ processes on a different machine, however, may not see the updates
 immediately, or ever.
 Whether or not the updates are seen depends on when and if the underlying operating system
 refreshes certain virtual memory pages. They may be only partly seen when items do not
 correspond to pages.<P>
When a mapped file is an argument to a defined function, the corresponding local variable
 is, of course, also a mapped file. If that argument is a global variable, then both
 variables, global and local, refer to the same file, and therefore can affect each other's
 values if they have write access to the file. If they have read access only and one
 variable is used for writing, then it is no longer a mapped file, but this change in its
 status naturally does not affect the other variable. In short, at the point at which the
 function is called they are two independent variables referring to the same file.<P>
To obtain just the value of a mapped file, i.e., a copy of the file, the Right function can
 be used. See the examples below.<P>
<A NAME=13>The <font face=Kapl>à</font> primitive function (Map or Map In, or Beam) is used
 to create, reference and update mapped files.

<H3><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Error Messages</FONT></H3>
<blockquote>
If a Map operation fails, you should get a domain error.&nbsp; A more specific error
 message appears in the session log if one is generated by Unix itself.&nbsp; (The message
 is not guaranteed to appear, but Unix so reports most problems.)&nbsp; If the Map is
 within a protected do, the do result shows the domain error, not the specific error.&nbsp;
 To help determine the cause of the failure, you can use <font face=Kapl>sys.errno{}</font>
 to retrieve the Unix error number, although exactly which system call failed will
 sometimes be ambiguous.<P>
If an "Operation would block" (or perhaps "interrupted system call") error message is
 received, it usually means that there has been a temporary network outage or extreme
 slowdown, so the map operation timed out. Before reporting this problem to the user, A+
 makes repeated attempts to carry out the operation, over a period of about a minute. Be
 aware that such a delay can occur.<P>
If a "not an `a object" error message is received, it may mean that the address space for
 all mapped files (including atmp) has been exhausted, and that therefore the file header
 does not agree with the file body. Mortgage files can be especially large, and may
 contribute to the exhaustion of this 1Gb to 4Gb space.<P>
If a file opened for reading only is "wrong-endian", it is copied into a variable in atmp
 and a warning message is issued.  For writing, including local writing, Beam rejects a
 "wrong-endian" file.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent <A NAME=16>Reading and Writing
 of a Mapped File</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
When two users, A and B, say, map the same NFS file (as A+ variables), A for writing and B
 only for reading, what B sees when A makes a change depends upon the location of their
 machines and the file in the network:<P>
<OL>
<LI>A and B are on the same machine and A updates the file in place. B will see the change
 immediately, regardless of whether B mapped the file before or after A made the change.<P>
<LI>A and B are on the same machine and A uses <font face=Kapl>_items</font> and appends
 to the file before B maps (or remaps) the file. B will see the change immediately.<P>
<LI><A NAME=17>Like 2, but A uses <font face=Kapl>_items</font> after B maps the file.
 There is no problem unless A has created a new page and B attempts to reference the new
 page, in which case B will get a segv error.<P>
<LI><A NAME=20>Like 1, 2, and 3 except that A and B are on different machines. The results
 are more or less the same as in those three cases but may be delayed. Unix looks for a
 page in its cache first, and uses it if it is there. Depending on system activity, a page
 may remain in the cache even after it has been changed on another machine, as NFS has no
 way of knowing that the page has been changed. Hence B will see A's change only after the
 affected old pages are removed from the cache by the system to make way for more recently
 referenced pages. B can get the new pages by remapping the file before referencing it (and
 after A's changes), unless A has engaged in the bad practice of changing the file on a
 machine other than the one on which it resides - in which case any changed pages will have
 to make their way via NFS to the host machine for the file before users on any other
 machines see them.<P>
<LI><A NAME=21>A and B and the file are all on the same machine and A rewrites (remaps) the
 file. The system creates a new file (a new "inode") and gives it the old name. If anyone
 has the old copy of the file opened or mapped (the reference count is greater than zero),
 the system keeps the old file around with the old inode. When B references the mapped
 variable (without remapping), the reference is by inode and therefore to B's private copy
 of the old file; A's newly written file is not seen. These old copies take up space on
 disk and remain until no user has them opened or mapped.<P>
<LI><A NAME=24>Like 5 except that but B is on a different machine from A and the file, and
 suppose enough activity has occurred after A rewrote the file to flush the cache in B's
 machine. A reference to the mapped file by B will produce a "Stale NFS file handle" error
 report if no one on A's machine has happened to keep the file's reference count above zero
 and thus preserved the old inode. The system in B's machine has gone looking for an inode
 that no longer exists (inodes are unique with a domain).<P>
<LI>Like 6 except that A renames the file before rewriting (remapping) it (under its
 original name). Then B sees the old file, as it was before A's actions, even if enough
 activity has occurred to flush the cache in B's machine, because the old copy of the file,
 under the old inode, is still around. (For example, files in the mas database that get
 rewritten are first renamed.)
</OL>
<b><A NAME=25><font color=Red>Warning!</font></b> An application can crash, with a bus
 error, if two or more users are writing (not necessarily at the same instant) in the same
 mapped file. The mapped file mechanism does not mediate independent updates.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mapped Files On Remote Machines</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
Using mapped files across NFS or AFS is problematic for anything other than a simple read,
 and sometimes even for that. A job which will run on one machine and access data in mapped
 files on another machine should probably have a server process on the machine where the
 files are. The application should then submit queries and updates and receive data through
 an <a href="APlusRefV2_54.html">adap</a> connection to that server.

</font><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguments</b><BLOCKQUOTE>
<font face=Kapl>y</font> is an integer and <font face=Kapl>x</font> is a symbol or
 character string, or <font face=Kapl>y</font> is a symbol or a character string and
 <font face=Kapl>x</font> is a simple character or numeric array.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition</b><BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME=29>There are two cases.<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME=33>If <font face=Kapl>y</font> is an integer, then <font face=Kapl>x</font>
 names a mapped file. The argument <font face=Kapl>x</font> can give a path to the file as
 well as the file name. If no path is given, the environment variable APATH is referenced
 for the search path. If the file name ends with the suffix "<font face=Kapl>.m</font>"
 the search is simply for a file with that name. Otherwise, the suffix
 "<font face=Kapl>.m</font>" is appended to the name and a file with that augmented
 name is sought; if the search fails, then a file with the original name (without the
 "<font face=Kapl>.m</font>") is sought. (Notice that this search order is opposite from
 that for the Load command, which applies suffixes only if the search using the given name
 fails.)  In this case (<font face=Kapl>y</font> an integer), <font face=Kapl>y</font> can
 have one of three values:<P>
<UL>
<A NAME=34><font face=Kapl>0àx </font>&nbsp; Open the file for reading only. Writing in a
 file opened for reading only (!) is treated like ordinary assignment: the data to be
 written is inserted in a <i>copy</i> of the mapped file, which is thereafter treated like
 an ordinary array.<P>
<A NAME=35><font face=Kapl>1àx </font>&nbsp; Open the file for reading and writing. The
 system function <font face=Kapl>_items</font> is used to allocate space for the file; see
 the examples below. In AIX, this function causes the timestamp to change even if you make
 no changes to the file, because A+ overwrites the first four bytes as part of the beam-in
 procedure.<P>
<A NAME=36><font face=Kapl>2àx </font>&nbsp; Open the file for reading and local writing.
 Writing in a file opened for only local writing causes the overwritten pages and the first
 page, which contains the header, to be written as if part of an ordinary array, while
 pages not overwritten through this variable are read from the file. In other words, when
 a process uses <font face=Kapl>2à...</font> access, the resulting mapped-file variable
 cannot change the file that others see, but there is the efficiency of sharing pages that
 the process has not changed and the advantage of seeing any changes that were made via
 <font face=Kapl>1à...</font> access to these pages by other processes. <i>Warning:</i>
 Items may not coincide with pages, so with <font face=Kapl>2à...</font> access you may see
 only part of someone else's change, even on the same machine.<P>
</UL>
<LI>In the second case for this primitive, <font face=Kapl>y</font> is a symbol or
 character string naming a file and <font face=Kapl>x</font> is a simple character or
 numeric array;&nbsp; the effect is to create the mapped file named in
 <font face=Kapl>y</font> with the value <font face=Kapl>x</font>.&nbsp; If the file name
 in <font face=Kapl>y</font> ends with "<font face=Kapl>.</font>" followed by anything or
 nothing (unlike the first case, which treats only "<font face=Kapl>.m</font>" specially),
 then it is used as the name of the created file;&nbsp; otherwise, the name of the file is
 the value of <font face=Kapl>y</font> with "<font face=Kapl>.m</font>" appended.
</UL>
When a file is mapped, the Unix command sequence is<font face=Courier>&nbsp;
 open();&nbsp;mmap();&nbsp;close()</font>.<font face=Courier>&nbsp; close() </font>does not
 unmap the file but does free the file descriptor. When the file is unmapped - by assigning
 a new value to the variable, expunging the variable, ending the A+ session, or whatever
 -<font face=Courier> munmap() </font>is called.
