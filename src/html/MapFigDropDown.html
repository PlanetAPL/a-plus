<dt><b>Presence</b><p>
<dd>The menu appears when the user presses <b>Enter</b> while the widget has keyboard focus
 or presses any mouse button while the pointer is on the
 <a href="MapFigValueChoiceArea.html">value area</a>.&nbsp; It disappears when a choice is
 made or choosing is aborted, as described under "Function".<p>
<dt><b>Function</b><p>
<dd>For menu invocation, selection, choosing, and aborting, mouse and keyboard actions
 can be used interchangeably.&nbsp; At any point, either can be used, regardless of how
 the present state was arrived at.<p>
The current choice initially appears selected (raised) on the menu.&nbsp; The selection can
 be changed either by pressing the <b>Up Arrow</b> and <b>Down Arrow</b> keys or by moving
 the mouse pointer over the menu while any mouse button is pressed.<p>
The current selection can be chosen either by pressing the <b>Enter</b> key or by releasing
 any mouse button while the pointer is on the menu.&nbsp; Any item can be chosen by
 clicking on it with any mouse button - including some other button while one is being held
 down.<p>
Choosing can be aborted either by pressing the <b>Escape</b> key or by releasing any mouse
 button while the mouse is off the menu - including some other button while one is being
 held down.<p>
<dt><b>Position</b><p>
<dd>As far as allowed by the position of the widget on the screen, the left edge of the
 menu is aligned with the left edge of the value area and the top edge of the initially
 raised area (containing the currently chosen item) is aligned with the top edge of the
 value area.<p>
<dt><b>Size</b><p>
<dd>The menu is sized to contain the <a href="MapFigMenuLabels.html">labels</a> in their
 specified font (subject, of course, to the limitation of screen size).<p>
<dt><b>Color</b><p>
<dd>The color is determined by the <font face=Kapl color=red>`bg</font> attribute.&nbsp; It
 is grey by default (more precisely, the value of
 <font face=Kapl color=red>s.GREY</font>).<p>
