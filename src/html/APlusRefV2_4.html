In this chapter, the concepts of A+ data and the vocabulary used in describing them are discussed first.  Then some A+ primitive functions for creating and indexing arrays and for inquiring into their characteristics are introduced.  In these sections a number of examples of arrays are given.  Finally, certain classes of arrays which are useful in the description of A+ functions are treated.

<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">Concepts and <A NAME=2>Terminology</FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>The data objects in A+ are <i>arrays</i>, which can be visualized as rectilinear arrangements of individual values.  An individual value in an array is called an <i>element</i>.  In the simplest arrays, the elements are either all numbers or all characters.  A number or a character is itself an array, of the most elementary kind.<P>
<A NAME=8>In the rectangular visualization of an array, each set of parallel edges defines a direction.  Corresponding to each of these directions is an <i>axis</i>.  The axes of an array are ordered.  In the visualization of an array with three axes, the first axis is directed away from the viewer, the second is directed downward, and the third is directed to the right.  A two-dimensional display of an array with three axes shows it as a series of planes arranged vertically, representing cross sections perpendicular to the first axis.  The term <i>leading axes</i> is used for any set composed of all the axes from the first up to some particular axis, inclusive, and <i>trailing axes</i> for any set composed of all the axes from some particular axis through the last one.<P>
<A NAME=16>An array with no axes, necessarily consisting of a single element, is called a <i>scalar</i>.  All elements of arrays are scalars.  Arrays with one axis are called <i>vectors</i> or <i>lists</i>, or, if character, <i>strings</i>.  Arrays with two axes are called <i>matrices</i>, and sometimes<i> tables</i>.  A set of elements lying along, i.e., parallel to, the first axis of a matrix is called a <i>column</i>, and a set along the second axis a <i>row</i>, just the same as in ordinary usage for tables.  These terms are also used for elements along the two trailing axes of arrays with more than two axes.

<A NAME=HEADING36>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimension, <A NAME=17>Shape, and Rank</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
The <A NAME=20><i>length of an axis</i> is the number of elements lying along any one of the edges defining that axis.  This length is also called a <i>dimension</i>, so an array has as many dimensions as axes.  (The word dimension is sometimes used as a synonym for the word axis, but not in this manual.)  The vector composed of the lengths of all axes of an array, i.e., the vector of dimensions, is called the <i>shape</i> of the array.  The ordering of the dimensions in the shape is the same as the ordering of the axes to which they correspond.  The total number of elements in an array can be found by multiplying together all the elements of its shape.<P>
An array can be <A NAME=21><i>empty</i>, that is, it can have no elements at all.  An empty array can have any number of axes except zero, which is disallowed, essentially because you can't have an empty container without a container.  At least one of the dimensions of an empty array is equal to zero.<P>
The <A NAME=22><i>rank</i> of an array is the number of its axes, and therefore it is also the number of elements in its shape, i.e., the length of its shape.  A scalar has an empty shape - its shape is a vector that has no elements - and its rank is 0.  (Incidentally, when all the elements of an empty vector are multiplied together the result is 1, by convention, so that the usual formulation for the number of elements in an array <font face=Kapl>a</font> - namely, <font face=Kapl>«/Òa</font> - works for scalars also.)<P>
<A NAME=24>Every element of an array can be referenced by a set of coordinates called <i>indices</i>, to retrieve the value of the element or to give it a new value.  There is one index, or coordinate, for each axis, and A+ defines its value to be an integer between zero and one less than the length of that axis, inclusive.  The number of indices of an element in an array, then, equals the rank of the array.<P>
<A NAME=26>Some computational languages use the word <i>cell</i> as a synonym for element, but A+ does not (except in connection with the displays created by s, the screen management system): <i>cell</i> is used in connection with the partitioning of an array, as defined by a set of leading axes.  In practice, multidimensional arrays are commonly viewed as partitioned into collections of lower dimensional arrays.  For example, a numeric matrix containing bond prices may be organized so that the rows are time series of prices for bonds, with one row for each bond of interest, while the columns are collections of prices at particular times.  For some calculations the rows would be emphasized, while for others, emphasis would be on the columns.  One view represents a partition of the matrix into a collection of row vectors, and the other into column vectors.<P>
<A NAME=27>A+ emphasizes partitions where the lower dimensional arrays lie along a set of trailing axes.  The lower dimensional arrays that comprise such a partition are called cells.  The complementary set of leading axes is called the <i>frame</i> of the partition that <i>holds</i> the cells; the cells are said to be <i>in their frame</i>.  In the case of the numeric matrix of bond prices, the row vectors are the cells of rank 1, and the first axis is their frame.<P>
Every set of leading axes defines a partition into cells for which it is the frame.  The set of all axes is a particular set of leading axes, and therefore defines a partition.  Since there are no axes left for the cells, the cells must be the elements of the array; the A+ notion of cell, then, includes the more common one.  At the other extreme, the array itself is a cell, i.e., a partition of itself into one subarray.  In this case the cell takes all the axes and therefore the frame has no axes.<P>
A cell consists of all those elements that have one particular set of indices for the leading
 axes that define the partition, and all possible indices for the trailing axes. The entire
 cell can be selected by specifying only the particular indices for the leading axes. Those
 leading axes are the frame of the partition, and therefore the frame is, loosely speaking,
 an array of cells that can be indexed by valid indices of them.  A partition creates, then,
 a view of an array as a frame of cells.  There is more about frames and cells, including
 several examples, <A HREF="#61">later</A> in this chapter. The
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_11.html#0">Dyadic Operators</A>" chapter, and especially its
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_11.html#23">Rank Deriving Dyadic</A>" section, has a further
 discussion of this subject, with examples.<P>
<A NAME=28>One partition plays a special role in A+, the one defined by the first axis alone; the cells for this partition are called the <i>items</i> of an array.  Every array can be regarded as a vector of items, and many A+ functions look at them in just that way.  In such a context, a scalar is regarded as having a single item, namely itself.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING37>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type and Nesting</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>Another characteristic of arrays is type.  In a simple array (definition later), all elements have the same type, but a nonsimple array can contain elements of several different types.
<P>
<A NAME=32>The most common simple arrays are numeric and character.  Every element of a
 simple numeric array is a number, and every element of a simple <i>character</i> array is
 a character.  Numeric arrays can be of either <i>integer</i> or <i>floating-point</i> type.
  These two types correspond to whole numbers and fractional (sometimes called decimal)
 numbers.  A+ numeric primitive functions applied to integer arrays may automatically
 convert their arguments to floating point, like the Matrix Inverse function, or may attempt
 to produce an integer result, like Add and Subtract.  If an overflow occurs during this
 attempt, the type of the result is changed to floating point.
<P>
<A NAME=35>The type of a simple array may also be <i>symbol</i> or <i>function</i> if it is nonempty, or <i>null</i> if it is empty.  A symbol is a character string represented as a single scalar; it is denoted by a backquote followed by the string, as in <font face=Kapl>`sym</font>.  A function expression, e.g., <font face=Kapl>ß</font> or <font face=Kapl>+.«</font>, and a function scalar, e.g., <font face=Kapl>&lt;{-}</font>, both have type function.<P>
<A NAME=39>While the elements of arrays are often just individual numbers and characters, an element of an array can be an encapsulated multielement array.  That is, any array can be <i>enclosed</i> to become a scalar, and this scalar can be an element of another array.  Also, any enclosed array, except a function scalar, can be <i>disclosed</i>, in order to work with its contents.  (A function scalar is an enclosed function expression.  The operator Apply, given a function scalar, produces the underlying function expression.)  An array that has an enclosed element other than a function scalar is called <i>nested</i>, and one that has no enclosed elements except function scalars is called <i>simple</i>.  A function scalar is simple, but an enclosed function scalar is nested.  Any nested array is necessarily nonempty, being or containing a scalar.
<P>
A simple scalar symbol or function scalar can be an element of a nested array. In order for
 data whose type is character, integer, floating point, function, or null to appear in a
 nested array, however, it must first be enclosed.  Clearly, any nonscalar array must be
 enclosed before being inserted as an element in another array, since the elements of all
 arrays must be scalars.
<P>
<A NAME=40>When an array other than a function expression is enclosed, the resulting array is a scalar of type <i>box</i>.  The type of a nonscalar nested array is the type of its first item.  Since a nested array can contain elements whose types are box, symbol, and function, its type can be any one of these three.  The disclosure of a box scalar, of course, can yield an array of any type.<P>
Any <A NAME=42>empty array is simple, because if it were nested, it would contain an enclosed array.  An empty array that is reshaped or selected from a character, integer, or floating-point array is of the same type.  Empty arrays of these three types can also be produced by explicit type transformations from empty arrays of these types.  The type of an empty array of symbols, functions, nulls, or boxes is null.  The empty vector whose type is null is called Null or the Null; it can be represented as <font face=Kapl>()</font>.<P>
<A NAME=43>There is also a type called <i>unknown</i>, to guard against weird cases that might arise.  It will not be mentioned further, except in the description of the Type function.

<A NAME=HEADING38>
<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">Creating <A NAME=44>Arrays</FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>A+ provides direct ways to specify constant arrays. A list of numbers separated
 by blank spaces is one description of a simple constant numeric array. For example, the
 constant<p>
<font face=Kapl>10&nbsp;2.3e-2&nbsp;34.156</font><p>
is a floating-point array with
 one axis, of length three.  The element at index 0 is 10, at index 1 is .023, and at 2 is
 34.156.  The expression with <font face=Kapl>e</font> means take the number on the left
 and multiply it by ten to the power shown on the right.  If you omit the blanks between
 numbers - a poor idea indeed, since it would make your code very difficult to read - , A+
 will give you a numeric vector, but probably not the one you intended. If a number is
 being parsed and a character is examined that can't be part of the number, then a new
 number is started if the character could begin a number. For instance,<p>
<font face=Kapl>1e-3.5&nbsp;40.358.62.7</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is read by A+ as&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <font face=Kapl>0.001&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;40.358&nbsp;0.62&nbsp;0.7</font><P>
Simple symbol vectors can be written similarly, and blanks are not needed.  One of length five is<p>
<font face=Kapl> `sym1&nbsp;`sym2&nbsp;`sym3`sym4`sym5</font><P>
It is also easy to describe simple constant character vectors.  For
 example,<p>
<font face=Kapl>'axrTVw'</font><p>
is a character array with one axis, of length
 six.  The elements at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are, respectively,<font face=Kapl>
 'a'</font>,<font face=Kapl> 'x'</font>,<font face=Kapl> 'r'</font>,<font face=Kapl>
 'T'</font>,<font face=Kapl> 'V'</font>, and<font face=Kapl> 'w'</font>.&nbsp; The empty
 character vector can be written most easily as<font face=Kapl> ''</font> - just two
 quotation marks, with nothing between them.<P>
<A NAME=47>A nested vector can be described conveniently by a <i>strand</i>, a parenthesized
 expression in which the vector's elements are separated by semicolons.  Enclosure of each
 element is implied by strand notation.  For example,
<p>
<font face=Kapl>(`sym; +; 1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3&nbsp;4; 1.7&nbsp;3.14; 'example';)</font>
<p>
is a nested vector of length six. The blanks after the semicolons are not required, but
 usually promote readability. All of its elements except the second are of type box; the
 second is a simple function scalar. The types (lengths) of its elements when each is
 disclosed are: symbol (a scalar), function (a scalar), integer (4), floating point (2),
 character (7), and null (0). The absence of an expression in any position of the strand
 implies a Null.
<P>
<A NAME=48>Arrays with more than one axis can be formed using the dyadic primitive function
 called Reshape and denoted by <font face=Kapl>Ò</font> (rho).  For example, the result of
 the expression
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     2 3Ò'axrTVw' ã </font>Enter this in an A+ session, and press <b>Enter</b>.<font face=Kapl>
axr               ã </font>This row and the next display the result.<font face=Kapl>
TVw               ã </font>Text following "<font face=Kapl>ã</font>" is a comment.</pre>
is an array with two axes - a matrix.  The left argument of Reshape in this example is a
 vector, specifying the shape of the result.  The index of an element in the matrix is a
 pair consisting of one index for axis 0, and one for axis 1. For instance, the
 element<font face=Kapl> 'r' </font>is indexed by the pair 0, 2.<P>
<A NAME=49>The monadic primitive function called Interval and denoted by
 <font face=Kapl>É</font> (iota) is somewhat like Reshape.  It creates arrays of any
specified shape whose elements are the integers 0, 1, ... .  For example,
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     É17          ã </font>Simple vectors are always displayed horizontally<font face=Kapl>
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16</font></pre>
is an array with one axis.  Note that this array has 17 elements, and the index of the
 i-th element is i for every i from 0 to 16.<P>
The Interval primitive can also create arrays with more than one axis.  For example:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     É2 3 5       ã </font>Enter this in an A+ session, and press <b>Enter</b>.<font face=Kapl>
  0  1  2  3  4   ã </font>These seven rows (one blank) show the result,<font face=Kapl>
  5  6  7  8  9   ã </font>which is equal to<font face=Kapl> 2 3 5 Ò É2«3«5
 10 11 12 13 14   ã </font>(which could be written<font face=Kapl> 2 3 5ÒÉ2«3«5</font>).<font face=Kapl>
                  ã </font>A blank line separates planes. If there were a fourth axis,<font face=Kapl>
 15 16 17 18 19   ã </font>two blank lines would separate subarrays corresponding to<font face=Kapl>
 20 21 22 23 24   ã </font>indices along the first axis, with single blank lines between<font face=Kapl>
 25 26 27 28 29   ã </font>subarrays corresponding to indices along the second axis.</pre>
<A NAME=53>The empty integer vector is most easily written <font face=Kapl>É0</font> and
 the empty floating-point vector <font face=Kapl>0Ò0.</font> (decimal point). In displays,
 all empty arrays occupy one (blank) line, except the Null, which occupies no display space
 at all.
<P>
The function <A NAME=55>Enclose, denoted by <font face=Kapl>&lt;</font>, is used to enclose arrays; <font face=Kapl>&lt;</font> is used also to indicate enclosure in displays:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     &lt;É2 5        ã </font>Much like the previous example, but an enclosed scalar.<font face=Kapl>
&lt;  0 1 2 3 4      ã </font>The  <font face=Kapl> &lt; </font>is used to indicate enclosure.<font face=Kapl>
   5 6 7 8 9      ã &lt; </font>is displayed only at the start of each enclosed array.</pre>
Strand notation can be combined with Enclose:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     (1 2 3;&lt;1 2 3;'abc';+;`smbl;) ã </font>The last element is Null.<font face=Kapl>
&lt;  1 2 3          ã </font>Strand encloses the simple vector.<font face=Kapl>
&lt; &lt;  1 2 3        ã </font>Strand encloses the enclosed vector.<font face=Kapl>
&lt;  abc            ã </font>Enclosed character vector.<font face=Kapl>
&lt;  +              ã </font>Enclosed function expression.<font face=Kapl>
&lt;  `smbl          ã </font>Enclosed symbol.<font face=Kapl>
&lt;                 ã </font>Enclosed Null.</pre>

<A NAME=HEADING39>
<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">Indexing <A NAME=56>Arrays</FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>A+ provides primitive functions to access the elements of an array.  One such function is denoted by the bracket pair <font face=Kapl>[]</font> and is called Bracket Indexing.  For example, using arrays displayed in the previous section:
<pre><font face=Kapl>     'axrTVw'[4]
V
     'axrTVw'[5 0 1]
wax
     (`sym;+;1 2 3 4;1.7 3.14;'example';)[2]
&lt;  1 2 3 4
     (É2 3 5)[0;1;3]
 8</font></pre>
An omitted index implies all permitted indices for that axis, so one can easily obtain a row and a column:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     (É2 3 5)[0;0;]  ã </font>The first row.<font face=Kapl>
 0 1 2 3 4
     (É2 3 5)[0;;4]  ã </font>The fifth column of the first plane of the array;<font face=Kapl>
 4 9 14              ã </font>vector result.</pre>
<A NAME=58>For a 3-dimensional array, an item is a matrix.  In Bracket Indexing, a semicolon may be omitted when all the indices following it are omitted, so one can index an array as if it were a vector containing the array's items:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     (É2 3 5)[1]     ã </font>The second item: any element of it is<font face=Kapl>
 15 16 17 18 19      ã (É2 3 5)[1;j;k]</font> for some <font face=Kapl>j</font> and <font face=Kapl>k</font>.<font face=Kapl>
 20 21 22 23 24
 25 26 27 28 29</font></pre>
<A NAME=61>More generally, one can index an array of rank r as if it were an (r-n)-rank
 array (frame) of rank-n cells.  Say one has a five-dimensional array; one can view it as a
 three-dimensional array of two-dimensional cells:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     (É 4 5 6 2 3)[0;0;0] ã </font>Any element of the first cell is<font face=Kapl>
 0 1 2              ã (É 4 5 6 2 3)[0;0;0;j;k]</font>for some <font face=Kapl>j</font>, <font face=Kapl>k</font>.<font face=Kapl>
 3 4 5              ã </font>The first three indices index the frame.</pre>
<A NAME=63>One more example demonstrates the power of working with items, frames, and cells.
  For this example, a small part of the capability of the primitive function Take
 (<font face=Kapl>Ù</font>) and the primitive operator Rank (<font face=Kapl>@</font>) must
 be explained.  For positive <font face=Kapl>n</font>, the expression
 <font face=Kapl>nÙa</font> produces the first <font face=Kapl>n</font> items of
 <font face=Kapl>a</font>.  The derived function <font face=Kapl>Ù@1</font> applies Take to
 all cells of rank 1 in its right argument, i.e., to all rows, whose items are elements.
 Taking a certain number of elements in each row is equivalent to taking a certain number of
 columns.  Thus the following expression takes three rows (items of a matrix) after taking
 five columns of a five by ten matrix:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>     3Ù5Ù@1 É5 10   ã  3Ù(5(Ù@1)(É5 10)) </font>is equivalent.<font face=Kapl>
  0  1  2  3  4     ã  ÕÕ Õ....Õ
 10 11 12 13 14     ã  ÕÕ</font> Take 5 columns.<font face=Kapl>
 20 21 22 23 24     ã </font>Take 3 rows.</pre>

<A NAME=66>The primitive function denoted by the monadic (i.e., one-argument) form of the

<A NAME=70>A shorter definition of a <i>simple</i> array is any array whose depth does not
 exceed 0.  A <i>nested</i> array, which is any array that is not simple, can be defined
 similarly as one whose depth is at least 1.

<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>A special form of nested array called a<i> slotfiller</i> is recognized by
 certain primitive functions and toolkits.  A slotfiller is a two-element
 vector<font face=Kapl> (sym;val)</font>.<font face=Kapl> sym </font>is a simple vector or
 scalar of distinct symbols.<font face=Kapl> val </font>has the same number of items
 as<font face=Kapl> sym </font>(recall that a scalar has one item).  It can be either any
 nested scalar or any vector each of whose items either has a depth of at least 1 or is a
 function scalar that is the enclosure of a <i>defined</i> function.  Thus primitive
 functions can appear in<font face=Kapl> val </font>only when they are enclosed at least
 twice, i.e., as enclosed function scalars.  A slotfiller can be thought of as a dictionary
 of keys (with no repetitions) and values.<P>
There is a way to test whether a variable or an expression is a slotfiller or
 not:<font face=Kapl> _issf x </font>is 1 if <font face=Kapl>x</font> is a slotfiller and 0
 if it is not.  Cf. the "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_14.html#105">Is a Slotfiller</A>" section in
 the "System Functions" chapter.<P>
Examples of slotfillers are:<BR>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(`small `medium `large `super;(16;32;64;72))<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(`a;&lt;97)<BR>
</font>and<BR>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(`g `l `w;(f;g;&lt;{+}))<BR>
</font>where <font face=Kapl>f</font> and <font face=Kapl>g</font> are user-defined
 functions, and <font face=Kapl>+</font> is enclosed by <font face=Kapl>&lt;</font> and the
 strand; but not<BR>
<font face=Kapl>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(`g `l `w;(+;-;«))<BR>
</font>since nonnested primitive functions are prohibited in slotfillers.<P>
Recall that when A+ displays a nested array, it uses an Enclose symbol
 (<font face=Kapl>&lt;</font>) to indicate the beginning of the display of each nested
 array.  It indents subarrays appropriately to show their total depth of nesting.  The
 first sample slotfiller is displayed as:
<pre><font face=Kapl>&lt;  `small `medium `large `super
&lt; &lt;  16
  &lt;  32
  &lt;  64
  &lt;  72</font></pre>
The <A HREF="APlusRefV2_8.html#195">Pick</A> function can extract values from slotfillers:
<pre></font><font face=Kapl>   `mediumØ(`small `medium `large `super;(16;32;64;72))
 32</font></pre>

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restricted <A NAME=77>Whole Numbers</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>Many functions require as arguments whole numbers that are within the range of
 integer representation but do not insist that the type of these arguments be integer.
 They also accept floating-point numbers that are tolerably equal to integers (see
 "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_9.html#3">Comparison Tolerance</A>") and numbers whose absolute value
 is less than </font><font face=Kapl>1e-13</font>.  I.e., they reject floating-point numbers
 that are significantly fractional or that are too large in magnitude to be represented as
 integer type. Furthermore, they accept empty arrays regardless of type.  For convenience in
 this manual, the term restricted whole number is used for a member of the set consisting of
 the integers, these floating-point near-integers, and all empty arrays.<P>
Since the functions that accept restricted whole number arguments use integers internally,
 floating-point values for these arguments involve a performance penalty, because of the
 implicit type conversion.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Types</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>Many A+ functions and operators take arguments of several types, sometimes with
 some limitation, and it is convenient to have a terminology dividing A+ data objects into
 three classes, as they do.  In this manual, these classes are called general types; they
 are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>character, consisting of simple arrays of characters
<LI><A NAME=81>numeric, consisting of simple arrays, unrestricted as to value, of
<UL type=disc>
<LI>floating-point numbers
<LI>integers
</UL>
<LI>mixed, containing all other data, namely
<UL type=disc>
<LI>simple arrays of
<UL type=disc>
<LI>functions
<LI>symbols
</UL>
<LI>all nested arrays
<UL type=disc>
<LI>box
<LI>function
<LI>symbol
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
Because general types are used mostly to indicate inclusion in the domains of functions and
 most functions accept empty arrays of any type, all empty arrays are included in each
 general type.  (Although acceptance of empty arrays can cause anomalies like a character
 result for Add, such results are unlikely in fact to be created; if they do arise, they
 will probably be accepted by any function to which they are presented. For efficiency, the
 (empty) result of a mathematical function for a Null is whatever is most convenient for the
 function: Null, integer, or floating point.)
