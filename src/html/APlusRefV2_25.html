<blockquote>
An attribute associated with certain button presses or certain key presses or other events
 can be assigned an event callback function, which will be invoked whenever an associated
 button or key is pressed or event takes place. All these functions, except as noted, can
have from zero to three arguments, the basic syntax being
<pre><font face=Kapl>     ecfn{s;c;v}</font></pre>
where
<UL>
<LI><font face=Kapl>s</font> is static data (see below);<P>
<LI><font face=Kapl>c</font> is a symbol naming the context of the object in which the
 cursor was positioned when the key or button press took place or for which the event
 occurred; and<P>
<LI><font face=Kapl>v</font> is a symbol giving the unqualified name of this object.
</UL>
The arguments always have these meanings, in this order, no matter how many (or few) are
 used in the definition of the function.<P>
The value of an attribute with callback is given as either the function name, say
 <font face=Kapl>f</font>, or a pair <font face=Kapl>(f;)</font>, or a pair
 <font face=Kapl>(f;s)</font>, where <font face=Kapl>s</font> is an array. The form
 <font face=Kapl>(f;s)</font> specifies the function and its static data
 <font face=Kapl>s</font>. Both<font face=Kapl> f </font>and<font face=Kapl> (f;)</font>
 are equivalent to <font face=Kapl>(f;())</font>, indicating that the static data is Null.
 Note that the first element of the value of the attribute is a function, not the name of a
 function; if you use the name <font face=Kapl>f</font> in specifying an attribute, change
 the definition of <font face=Kapl>f</font>, and want the callback to use the new
 definition, you must specify the attribute again.<P>
The actions of some of these attributes depend on the row or cell that is currently
 selected; for example, the effect of the delete attribute is to delete the selected row.
 Whenever a function associated with one of these attributes is called because a key or
 button was pressed, some row or cell or trace in a displayed object must have been
 selected. Usually it is important to determine within the function which row or cell it
 is; the attributes row and col hold the row index and, when it is meaningful, the column
 index of the selected row or cell. The values of two other attributes are relevant here:
 the value of selected is the pair (row attribute, col attribute), and the value of
 selected field, which applies only to tables, is the nested array pair (row attribute;
 symbol holding the name of the selected field).<P>
Some of these attributes have default behavior. For example, the default behavior of the
 delete attribute is to delete the selected row. These attributes can be assigned
 functional values to change the default behavior, or simply be assigned 0 to turn the
 default behavior off. If off, the default behavior can be turned back on by setting the
 value to 1. The default behavior can also be turned off with
 <font face=Kapl>`false</font> or <font face=Kapl>`off</font> in place of 0, or turned back
 on with <font face=Kapl>`true</font> or <font face=Kapl>`on</font> in place of 1.<P>
When an attribute attr has a default behavior for the class to which an object
 <font face=Kapl>obj</font> is bound, that behavior can be invoked by
 <font face=Kapl>s.call{`obj;`attr}</font>. Thus, a callback function can be assigned to an
 attribute of an object that will, when called, make a decision whether or not to invoke
 the default action, to do some other work, or to do both or neither.<font face=Kapl>
 s.call </font><i>should</i> work for all attributes with default callback behaviors; it
 <i>will</i> work for all attributes listed in<font face=Kapl>
 0Øs.EVENT_CALLBACKS</font>.<P>

 corner of the character on which the pointer rested when the mouse button was pressed, and
 the diagonally opposite corner of the box moves with the pointer. The rubberband box as
 drawn disappears and an rband event occurs when the mouse button is released. If rband is
 0, the box attribute is unchanged and the page object appears unchanged. If rband is 1,
 the location and extent of the box that triggered the event is appended to the box
 attribute and the box is shown in the page object in the color indicated in boxcolor.</td>

<tr>
<td>refer</td>
<td><A NAME=34>In an array, matrix, table, or view object, a refer event occurs when the
 pointer is in a selected row or cell that has focus and the left mouse button or the
 <b>Enter</b> key is pressed. Hence it occurs as the result of a "double click" with the
 left mouse button in a row or cell. There is a default action for array, matrix, and
 table only, taken if refer is 1: highlight the referred row in the indexbg color and
 append the new value of the row attribute to the value of the index attribute. If refer is
 0, the default action is not taken. Pressing the left mouse button on a referred row
 removes the reference.<p>
In a password or scalar object, a refer event occurs when the mouse pointer is in either
 the title or value area, and the left mouse button is pressed. In a slot, the pointer can
 be in any label or value area. In a graph, the pointer can be anywhere on the graph; if
 the pointer is on a line trace, the event occurs for that trace. In all these cases, a
 refer event occurs only if the area has focus; there is no default action.</td>
<td>0 for array, matrix, table, and view;<BR>Null otherwise.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>save</td>
<td><A NAME=36>A save event occurs when <b>Ctrl-s</b> is pressed while an object
 bound to the text
 display class has focus. If save is 1, the edited text on the screen is saved in the
 workspace variable. If it is 0, this default action is not taken.</td>
<td>1</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>select</td>
<td><A NAME=38>There is no default action for mouse button presses or
 <b>arrow</b> key presses. This
 attribute can be set for an object of class array, matrix, table, or view, and the
 function to which it is set will be called whenever the mouse pointer is on a row or cell
 of the object, that row or cell is not currently selected, and the left mouse button is
 pressed. The selected cell appears raised and in the color specified by the selectbg
 attribute, while the rest of the selected row appears in the color specified by the rowbg
 attribute. Once a row or cell is selected the user can move from row to row or cell to
 cell with the <b>arrow</b> keys. With each press of an <b>arrow</b> key the row or cell
 in the indicated direction becomes selected, and the function is called.
 Orogrammatically setting a row or column to -1 causes a select callback.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>selectcol</td>
<td><A NAME=40>If 1, the default action is to highlight the
 selected column labels in the rowindexbg
 color and update the value of the colindex attribute with the row index of each selected
 column label.  If 0, the default action is not taken. This attribute can be set for a
 matrix, and the function to which it is set will be called whenever the mouse pointer is
 on the label area of a column and any mouse button is pressed. If there is a selected
 row at the time a column label is selected, it remains unchanged, but the selected cell
 becomes the one at the intersection of the selected row and the column beneath the newly
 selected column label. In particular, if a new cell is selected, a selected event occurs.
 Press any mouse button on a referred column to remove the reference.</td>
<td>0</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>selectcorner</td>
<td><A NAME=42>If 1, the default action is to highlight the selected corner
 label in the cornerindexbg
 color and change the value of the cornerindex attribute to 1. If 0, the default action is
 not taken. This attribute can be set for a matrix, and the function to which it is set
 will be called whenever the mouse pointer is on the label area of the upper left corner
 and any mouse button is pressed. Press any mouse button on the referred corner to remove
 the reference.</td>
<td>0</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>selectfield</td>
<td><A NAME=44>This attribute can be set for a table, and the
 function to which it is set will be
 called whenever the mouse pointer is on the title area of a field and any mouse button is
 pressed. If there is a selected row at the time a field title is selected, it remains
 unchanged, but the selected cell becomes the one at the intersection of the selected row
 and the field beneath the newly selected field title. In particular, if a new cell is
 selected, a selected event occurs.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>selectrow</td>
<td><A NAME=46>If 1, the default action is to highlight the selected row labels
 in the rowindexbg
 color and update the value of the rowindex attribute with the column index of each
 selected row label. If 0, the default action is not taken. This attribute can be set
 for a matrix, and the function to which it is set will be called whenever the mouse
 pointer is on the label area of a row and any mouse button is pressed. The row with the
 selected label becomes the selected row. If no row was selected at the time the row
 label is selected, the selected cell is the one in the first column of the selected row.
 If there was a selected cell at the time the row label was selected, the newly selected
 cell is the one in the same column, but in the newly selected row. In particular, if a
 new cell is selected, a selected event occurs. Press any mouse button on a referred row
 to remove the reference.</td>

<blockquote>
When <A NAME=68>text is clipped in an Emacs or XTerm window, say by dragging the pointer
 over the area while the left button is depressed, the text is written in the <i>primary
 selection buffer</i>, and when text is pasted into an Emacs or XTerm window, it is
 retrieved from the primary selection buffer.  A+ provides four attributes for using this
 buffer: primary, request, notify, and clear.<P>
To <A NAME=69>write in the primary selection buffer, give the primary attribute a character
 value. (Attempted settings with other types of data are quietly ignored; the value of
 primary remains unchanged.)  Since there is only the one buffer, the value of the
 attribute changes for all objects.<P>
To <A NAME=70>read the buffer, specify the request attribute for a bound object. If and
 when primary has been given a proper value, a notify event occurs and the buffer can be
 read by referencing the primary attribute.<P>
If the buffer is overwritten by another process (not by an object in this A+ process), the
 A+ object, if any, whose specification of the primary attribute was overwritten will
 undergo a clear event. Dragging the pointer over text in an Emacs, Xterm, or FrameMaker
 window, for example, will cause a clear event. The text that is highlighted can then be
 retrieved through primary, but text that Emacs demarcated by bouncing the cursor back and
 forth cannot - but can, however, after you press the "0 to PRIMARY" button in an xcutsel
 window.<P>
See the tutorial scripts, which are available
 under the "Tutorials" item on
 the "<a href="Documentation/index.html">On-Line Documents</a>" section of the home page.
The entry "s.tutorials/data" gives an example, for the view class.  It is an ASCII text file;  use Emacs to access it.
