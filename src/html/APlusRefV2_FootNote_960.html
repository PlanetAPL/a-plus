<tr><td>In practice, however, it is best for the listener to go first, for then the
 communication channel will be established immediately upon the connecting partner's
 execution of <font face=Kapl>adap.Connect</font>.  If the connecting partner goes first,
 then by design the time intervals between the attempts to connect get longer and longer,
 so that when the listening partner finally calls <font face=Kapl>adap.Listen</font>,
 there may be a long latency period before the communication channel is established.</td>
