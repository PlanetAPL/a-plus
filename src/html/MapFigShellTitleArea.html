<dt><b>Presence</b><p>
<dd>The shell title area appears when<ul>
<li>the object is top level, or
<li>it is a popup whose <font face=Kapl color=red>`head</font> attribute is 1 (the default);
</ul>its presence is not otherwise controllable.<p>
<dt><b>Function</b><p>
<dd>Besides providing an area in which the shell title is displayed, the shell title area
 acts as a button:<br>
When the left or middle mouse button is pressed on it, it appears depressed;&nbsp; if the
 mouse is then moved, double-pointed crossed arrows appear, centered at the spot in the
 shell title area that was pointed to, and the widget moves with the pointer, stopping when
 the button is released.<p>
When the right mouse button is pressed on it the window manager menu appears, just as for
 the <a href="MapFigMenuButton.html">menu button</a>.<p>
<dt><b>Size</b><p>
<dd>The shell title area's depth is controlled by the window manager, and is the same as
 that of the menu button.<p>
Its width is always at least as great as the menu button width, is <i>not</i> affected by
 the length of the shell title, and is determined by<ul>
<li>the width of the body,
<li>the attributes affecting overall size (see the "Size, position, etc. on screen or in
 parent" <a href="MapFigOverall.html">page</a>), and
<li>user resizing if <font face=Kapl color=red>`resizeable</font> is 1.</ul><p>
<dt><b>Color</b><p>
<dd>The color of the shell title area is controlled by the window manager; there is no A+
 interface for it.<p>
