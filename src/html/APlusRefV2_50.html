<A NAME=2>This chapter describes screen interactions in A+ applications from the user's point of view.  These interactions are covered from an application programmer's point of view in "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_21.html#0">Introduction to Screen Management</A>", "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_23.html#0">Display Attributes</A>", "<A HREF="APlusRefV2_25.html#0">Attributes with Callbacks</A>", and some of the chapters devoted to individual display classes - e.g., in a <A HREF="APlusRefV2_32.html#HEADING534">section</A> of the graph chapter.  Much of the behavior discussed in this chapter is due to the window manager of the underlying system.
<P>
Many screen interactions - repositioning objects, for instance - are with OLVWM or OLWM, rather than with A+, so some aspects of this interaction are discussed here; see "<A HREF="#9">The Window Manager</A>", below.  Windows for A+ applications contain buttons, menus, tables, etc., all with various forms of user interactions, which are discussed in "<A HREF="#37">The A+ Screen Manager</A>".  Not all interactions can be addressed in a general document like this one.  For example, applications may use any of the function keys <b>F1</b> through <b>F12</b> for any purpose, but there is no default use of these keys that can be discussed here.  For readers familiar with window-based applications, a fast path through this chapter is the first two sections of "<A HREF="#9">The Window Manager</A>" and the sections of "<A HREF="#37">The A+ Screen Manager</A>" up to "<A HREF="#HEADING587A">Interactions Peculiar To Individual Display Classes</A>".

<A NAME=HEADING568>
<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">The Mouse and Pointer</FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
The <A NAME=6><i>mouse</i> has three buttons, which in this manual are called simply the
 left button, middle button, and right button. (When the mouse has only two buttons, the
 middle button is simulated by using the other two buttons simultaneously.) Depressing a
 button and releasing it is called <i>clicking</i>. Clicking twice in rapid succession is
 called double clicking. For mouse buttons only, <i>pressing</i> a button always means
 holding the button down until you are told to release it. In this chapter, <i>button</i>
 means either a mouse button or a button object on the screen.<P>
<A NAME=7>Associated with the mouse is a <i>pointer</i>, which can appear anywhere on a workstation screen.  It may take several forms.  When it is in the shape of an arrow, it refers to the spot on the screen that is at the point of the arrow.  When it is in the shape of a target, you can resize a window.  When it is in the shape of a clock or stopwatch, the system is busy.  (See the <font face=Kapl><A HREF="APlusRefV2_57.html#258">s.BUSY</a></font> and <font face=Kapl><A HREF="APlusRefV2_57.html#259">s.CLOCK</a></font> parameters to change the appearance of the pointer.)  Usually key and button actions that occur when the clock is shown are stored and acted upon as soon as the system is not busy, but sometimes they are ignored.<P>
To click or press on an object, or when in some area, means to take that action when the pointer is in the designated place.  In particular, to press a button pictured on the screen means to place the point of the pointer on the button and to click or press a mouse button - usually, to click the left button.

<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>The screen can contain several windows, which appear as delineated rectangular
 areas.  The windows in the <A href="#GIF1">first figure</A> illustrate
 many of the variations that you may see in A+ applications.
 In A+, one speaks of top-level windows and popups.  Popup
 windows have pins, as illustrated by the middle two windows in the
 <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>; all other windows in shown there are top-level windows.
<P>
<A NAME=GIF1><font size=+1><b>Samples of Various A+ Windows:</b></font><P>
<IMG border=1 SRC="APlusRefV2_AFrame_1.gif">
<! IMG border=1 SRC="SampleWindows.gif">
<P>
<A NAME=13>Key and button actions apply to the window with <i>focus</i>, the window that the
 pointer is in.  Usually you are given a visual clue to the window with focus, such as a
 brightened or different-colored outline,
 like the top left window in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>.  A
 window may be composed of several objects, such as buttons and tables, and if the window has
 focus then at most one of these objects has <i>keyboard focus</i>, meaning that any keys
 that are pressed will affect that object.<P>
<A NAME=17>A window always has a <i>frame</i> around it, and the frame may have a
 <i>header</i> at the top or <i>footer</i> at the bottom, bands as wide as the window. The
 upper left window in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A> has both a header and a footer,
 the one on the upper right has neither, and the ones in the middle have headers only.
 The frame may also have raised corners at the frame corners called resize corners,
 as shown in these examples.
<p>
 In addition, windows may have:<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME=18>a button in the header, on the left side, called the window menu button (not
 found on popups); see the upper left window in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>;
<LI>a <A NAME=19>pin, shown either on its side or as if pushed into the screen (found only
 on popups); see the middle windows in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>;
<LI>a pointer;
<LI><A NAME=20>scroll bars, which can appear on the right and on the bottom; see the upper
 left window in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>;
<LI>movable dividers, which can be either vertical or horizontal; see the bottom window in
 the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>.
</UL>
<A NAME=21>The part of a window that is inside its frame is called the <i>body</i> of the window here.  Note that the header is not part of the body.  The body of a window may contain one or more objects, or panes.  The positions of the panes are fixed, but the user can make more of one pane visible and less of another if the pair is separated by a movable divider.<P>
Scroll bars actually belong to objects within windows - their behavior is not controlled by the OL[V]WM - and so it is common to see more than one vertical or more than one horizontal scrollbar in one window, as in the one at the bottom of the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>.  Multiple dividers in a window, though less common, are also possible.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING571>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select and Traverse</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>The visible sign that a window has been selected - given focus - is a brightening of its frame and frame outline; see the middle right window in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>.  You can select a window simply by moving the pointer into it.  (It is possible that a window may come up with the mouse pointer in it but without keyboard focus; if this happens, you can move the pointer out of the window and back into it to get keyboard focus.)  The keyboard may also be used to select a window, providing the means to step through the windows one at a time.  For this purpose a traversal order is established for each application.  When the pointer is in the body of one window of an application, you can select the next one in the traversal order by pressing <b>Control-Tab</b>.  To select the previous one, press <b>Shift-Control-Tab</b>.  When you use <b>Control-Tab</b> or <b>Shift-Control-Tab</b>, the pointer is automatically moved to the selected window.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING572>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front, and Raise and Lower</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>Overlapping windows are presented as if in three dimensions, and the one that is fully visible is said to be in front, or to be raised.  To lower a window is to place it furthest back, so that it is obscured by all windows that overlap it.  There are several ways to raise and lower windows.  They all act as toggles: if the window is not in front, it is moved there; if it is in front, it is moved to the back.<P>
On a keyboard with a <b>Front</b> key, place the pointer anywhere in the visible part of the window and press <b>Front</b> to place it in front or in back, depending upon its present position.  On a keyboard without such a key, position the pointer the same way, and press <b>Alt</b> and hold it while pressing <b>F5</b> (i.e., press <b>Alt-F5</b>).  Double-clicking the left button in a visible part of the header but not on the window menu button or pin (if any) will usually accomplish the same result, and pressing the right button there will generally produce a window manager menu that offers you this action.  Likewise, if there is a window menu button, pressing the right button on it will produce another menu that may offer you this action.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING573>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quit, <A NAME=26>and Open and Close</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>You can remove a window from the screen entirely by choosing <b>Quit</b> from its application menu.  Likewise, pressing the right button while in the header but not on the window menu button usually produces a window manager menu with <b>Quit</b> or, for popups, <b>Dismiss</b> as one of its options (although an application may choose not to honor a request to remove the window from the screen).   A popup may have a displayed button labeled <b>Done</b> or <b>Cancel</b> or the like, clicking on which has the effect of a <b>Quit</b> in addition to performing some task for the application.<P>
<A NAME=30>To leave a temporarily unused top-level window on the screen, but have it take up a lot less screen space, either choose <b>Close</b> from one of these menus or press the <b>Open</b> key (<b>Alt-F6</b> if you don't have <b>Open</b>) with the pointer anywhere on the window: the window is replaced by an icon, placed somewhere on the screen.  To restore the window as it was, except that it will be in front whether or not it was before: with the pointer on the icon, press the right button for a menu with <b>Open</b>, double click the left button, or press the <b>Open</b> key (or <b>Alt-F6</b>).<P>
For popup windows, <b>Close</b> is usually equivalent to <b>Dismiss</b>: the window is removed entirely from the screen; no icon appears for it.<P>
<A NAME=31>In A+, a programmer can designate windows that are followers of a given window.  When the window is closed, its followers will also be closed.  If a window was closed in this manner, then it will be opened when its leader window is opened.  So if you request that a window be open or closed, several windows may be affected.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING574>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>A window can be dragged around on the screen by placing the pointer on the frame
 anywhere that does not have special significance - within the header is a convenient
 place -, pressing the left button, moving the pointer and thereby the window to the
 desired location, and releasing the button.  During this operation, the window will
 continue to be displayed in its current location, but a rectangle, the outline of the
 frame, will follow the mouse, so that the potential locations can be seen.  Also, a small
 label or tag may appear that says "location:" and gives the horizontal and vertical
 coordinates in pixels of the location to which the upper left corner of the outline has so
 far been dragged.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING575>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resize</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>If a window has special corners, as do all but the middle left window in the
 <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>, it can be made larger or smaller by the user.  When the
 mouse pointer is moved to one of these corners, the pointer changes to a target.  Then you
 can press the left button, drag the corner wherever you want, and release the button.  The
 new size and shape of the window is established by the point to which you dragged that
 corner and the (original) location of the diagonally opposite corner.  During this
 operation, as during dragging, the display of the window remains unchanged but a rectangle
 gives the outline of the potential new frame for the current mouse location.  Also, a small
 label or tag may appear that says "size:" and gives the horizontal and vertical sizes
 corresponding to the current location, in characters and lines, respectively.<P>
In one or both dimensions, you can drag the selected corner past the fixed corner, which remains catercorner to it.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING576>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scroll</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=34>Sometimes not all the text or other contents of an object can be displayed in it.  When that happens for a dimension, horizontal or vertical, a scroll bar is displayed, an object that looks somewhat like an elevator shaft (see the window on the top left of the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A> and the bottom window).  At the ends, the scroll bar has anchors.  Connecting the anchors is a cable, with  a scroll box somewhere along the cable, (Openlook) or a channel with a slab in it (Motif).  Stops may appear on the cable that restrain the scroll box from moving all the way to an end, thereby preventing the view area of the object from becoming partially or completely vacant.  The relative size of the stops also indicates the proportion of the displayed object that is actually in view; the smaller the stops, the more out of view.<P>
<a name=64>Pressing the right mouse button</a> with the pointer on a scroll
 bar produces a menu that lets the viewer select the Openlook or Motif look or the beginning
 or end of the object being viewed. Any change in appearance is only for the scroll bar
 pointed to, so an ugly combination of vertical and horizontal scroll bars is possible.<p>
The left mouse button is used to select scrolling operations.  The top and bottom thirds of
 the scroll box have arrows.  Clicking on an arrow moves the display one element - e.g., line
 of text or row of data - in the
 indicated direction.  Pressing on an arrow causes the display
 to move one element at a time until the button is released.  Pressing on the middle of the
 scroll box and dragging it, by moving the pointer toward one anchor or the other, causes the
 appropriate part of the text to be displayed when the button is released.  Clicking on the
 cable above or to the left of the box moves the display back one windowful (unless an
 extremity is arrived at), and clicking on the cable below or to the right of the box moves
 the display ahead one windowful.  Pressing on the cable causes successive windowfuls to
 appear until the button is released.  Finally, clicking on an anchor causes the displayed
 text to include the corresponding extremity.<P>
There is also an action for the middle button: pressing on the cable moves the display so
 that the middle of the middle of the scroll box moves to the arrow position.<P>
<A NAME=35>
When a user scrolls an object, other objects may be automatically scrolled
 with it. When a user selects a row or column, the same row or column may be automatically
 selected in other objects, in which the first (displayed) row or column may consequently
 change. More elaborate coordination may occur, such as rows with columns, or title or
 label changes.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING577>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reapportion</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>Some windows permit a user to reapportion the relative areas allotted to certain
 objects.  Their special feature is movable sashes, or dividers, between objects, which allow
 you to control the proportion of the window that each object occupies, simply by moving the
 sashes.  To move a sash, just place the mouse pointer on it, press the left button, drag the
 sash where you want it, and release the button.  A small button is provided on the bottom of
 a vertical sash and on the right of a horizontal sash as a convenient place to locate the
 pointer.<P>
The bottom window in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A> has a vertical divider, which has been
 used to make more of the table on the left visible at the expense of the one on the right.
 There are also horizontal dividers to separate panes that are stacked vertically.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING578>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin and Unpin</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
Pinning is a facility that allows application programmers to give users the ability to influence the removal of popups.  For example, suppose an application has a single commit-or-cancel popup.  Normally, such a popup appears when needed and disappears after the user clicks one of its two buttons.  The application program can, however, include a pin, shown on its side, unpinned, as in the popups shown in this chapter.  If you prefer to leave this popup on the screen instead of having it come and go all the time, you place the pointer on the pin and click the left button, causing the pin to be shown pressed in.  The application program, before removing the popup, checks to see whether it was pinned, and if so, leaves it alone.  The application can also originally include a pin that is shown pushed in, allowing you to click on it and thus unpin the popup, indicating that you would like it removed.<P>
A+ popups are programmed so that when the pin is pulled out, the popup is removed from the screen.  The action is the same no matter who, programmer or user, pushed the pin in.  Thus clicking twice on an unpinned pin removes such a popup.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING579>
<H1><FONT color="#20B2AA">The <A NAME=37>A+ Screen Manager</FONT></H1>
<blockquote>
A+ provides for multiple objects within one window, each with its own scroll bars, buttons, and entry fields as required (cf. the bottom window in the <A href="#GIF1">figure</A>); for convenient movement between objects within a window, and within objects; for indicating actions to be taken through option selection and button presses; and for entering and editing data (even in graphical form).<P>
The interactions you can have with the display and the application program are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>selection and traversal: selecting an object or cell for choice or editing;
<LI>choice: choosing an action or actions, a row or rows of a table, or whatever;
<LI>editing: including input.
</UL>
All selections and choices can be made with the left mouse button, and the three forms of editing can be initiated with the three mouse buttons.  In addition, selections can also be made by pressing keys.  The behavior of the mouse buttons is presented first, followed by the forms of editing and the alternative forms of selection using keys.  Finally, there is a series of sections on user interactions that are special to particular display objects like graphs and pages.<P>
The visual form of some objects, such as menus, is distinctive and therefore easily recognized in applications.  In other cases objects with very different behavior look alike, e.g., buttons and selected input cells.  In practice, of course, confusion is unlikely because the actual behavior of an object will be clear from context, so a comparison of visual forms of the various objects is unnecessary.  The basic objects for specifying actions and editing in cells appear in the <A href="#GIF133">next figure</A>.<P>
<A NAME=GIF133><b>Various Input Objects</b><P>

<A NAME=HEADING580>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection <A NAME=38>using the Left Mouse Button</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
Along the top of the <A href="#GIF133">figure</A> are various action objects.  The object on the left with the title "Reports" is called a vertical cascade menu.  The <b>open</b> and <b>save</b> items have small triangles to their right indicating submenus.  Click on either item or triangle and a submenu will appear and remain visible.  Any submenu item that itself has a submenu also behaves this way.  Click on any item without a submenu and that action will be taken; any visible submenus will disappear as well.  Click anywhere outside the currently displayed submenu and no action will be taken; once again, any visible submenus will disappear.  You can also navigate the menu in the more usual fashion of putting the pointer somewhere on the menu, pressing the left button, and dragging the pointer up and down the menu items and over the submenu indicators.  If things freeze up during a menu operation, try pressing the <b>Esc</b> key.<P>
To the right of the vertical cascade menu are two other menus under the title "Data Selection".  The top one is a simple menu, holding a set of choices but no further submenus.  Click the left button on the triangle to the right of the title "Directory" and the submenu will appear.  Then click on any item and it will be chosen, as well as displayed to the right of the triangle.  The menu under the label "Directory" is a horizontal cascade menu; except for the top menu's being displayed horizontally, it is exactly like the vertical cascade menu.<P>
The next object to the right is a vertical set of buttons entitled "ReCalc".  Press any one of these buttons and the indicated action will be taken.  The selected button may appear with a colored band around it, or, depending on the application, some other color indicator.<P>
The next object to the right, entitled "Currency", is a check object, which allows you to select any number of items from the list.  Simply click on the object or the square next to it to select it, and click again to "deselect" it.  The squares appear depressed and (usually) in a different color to indicate selection.<P>
The final object of the top row of the <A href="#GIF133">figure</A>, the one all the way to the right, is a radio box.  It is like a check box, except that one and only item can be chosen (as in a pushbutton radio).  Check boxes always have square indicators, and radio boxes have diamond indicators.<P>
Below the top row of action objects is an array of cells.  Click on any one of them to select it, and it will appear raised.  Depending on the application, it may also have a different color, and all the cells in its row may have still another color.  Below that array of cells is another array of cells that differs from the first by having column labels C 1, C 2, etc.  Note that no cell is selected in this table.  A column can be selected by clicking on its label, and the default behavior is:<P>
<UL>
<LI>if there is no currently selected cell, the top cell in that column is selected;
<LI>if there is a currently selected cell, the cell at the intersection of the row of the currently selected cell and the selected column is selected.
</UL>
The application may do something different, e.g., compute a column total.<P>
Below the table of cells is a third variation that additionally has row labels and a corner label in the upper left. Any row or column can be selected, as well as the corner area, by clicking on its label.  Selecting a column proceeds in the same way as above, and selecting a row in a similar way.<P>
Finally, at the bottom there is an array of labelled, raised input cells.  Click on a cell or its label to select it; the default behavior is for the label and cell to appear with a highlighted border.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing using the Left Mouse Button; Multiple Selection</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>In the above examples of arrays of cells, a single click selects an individual cell or row.  Choosing must be done by double-clicking. Choosing causes a "refer" event to occur and a callback to be executed if a refer callback function was set.
<p>
There are two selection modes, single and multiple.<br>
In single selection mode, clicking the left mouse button on a cell, with the <b>Control</b> or <b>Shift</b> key or neither held down, selects that row and cell and eliminates any previous selection.<br>
In multiple selection mode: <b>Control</b>-click changes the selection status of the row pointed to; <b>Shift</b>-click extends a selected block to the row pointed to if that row is unselected, and reduces the block otherwise, to "deselect" the row; and click alone selects the row pointed to and eliminates any other rows from the selection. Each of these three actions has a variant, in which the left mouse button is held down and the pointer dragged, involving all the rows the pointer passes over.

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection using the Middle or Right Mouse Button</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
The cells in the arrays of the <A href="#GIF133">figure</A> are input-output cells.  Data can be displayed in them and users can enter new or modified data in them.  An application can protect cells so that users cannot modify them.  When a cell is protected, clicking on it with either the middle or right mouse button has the same effect as clicking on it with the left button, and also produces a beep.  If the cell is not protected, then clicking on it with the middle or right button, besides producing the ordinary left button effect, causes one of the three input modes to be automatically initiated.
</blockquote>
<A NAME=HEADING583>
<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>There are two input modes for cells such as those in the <A href="#GIF133">figure</A>:<P>
<UL>
<LI> <A NAME=42>overwriting, or replacement, character by character, anywhere in the
 field;<P>
<LI> <A NAME=43>insertion, anywhere in the field; if the mode is entered by just typing a
 character or pressing <b>Backspace</b>, the entire previous contents of the cell are
 deleted.
</UL>
To enter overwriting mode initially, select the cell using the middle mouse button, taking care that the pointer is at the position where the overwriting is to begin.  The text cursor is a blinking block positioned over the character to be overwritten.<P>
To enter insertion mode initially, either:  select the cell using the right mouse button, again taking care to position the pointer;  or, when the cell is
 already selected (perhaps by use of the left mouse button), either press the <b>Insert</b>
 key to begin at the end of the current contents, or press <b>Backspace</b> or just start to
 type to delete the previous contents.  The text cursor is a blinking a vertical bar at the
 insertion point.<P>
An attempt to enter either input mode when the selected cell is protected will elicit a
 beep.<P>
For an object of the array, command, matrix, scalar, slot, or table class, the space available for editing, in characters, is either 256 (with scrolling on entry and by use of the arrow keys) or the number that fits in the visible space.  An attempt to enter too many characters elicits a beep.<P>

Once an array of cells like those in the <A href="#GIF133">figure</A> has been selected using <b>Meta-Tab</b> and <b>Shift-Meta-Tab</b> (<b>Alt</b>, not <b>Meta</b>, on IBM keyboards), a cell within it is selected with the <b>Tab</b>, <b>Shift-Tab</b>, and <b>arrow</b> keys.  Arrays of labelled cells like the one entitled "Array of Labelled Cells" in the <A href="#GIF133">figure</A>, however, are an exception.  If the application is designed so that <b>Meta-Tab</b> traverses all the labelled cells, then the <b>Tab</b>, <b>Shift-Tab</b>, and <b>arrow</b> keys have no effect here.  However, if <b>Meta-Tab</b> selects only one labelled cell, then when that cell is selected, the <b>Tab</b>, <b>Shift-Tab</b>, and <b>arrow</b> keys can be used to select one of the other labelled cells.<P>
When keys are used to select a cell, any required scrolling is done automatically, and if
 no movement is possible in a given direction, the action of the corresponding key is

Items on a menu or submenu can also be selected by
 pressing the keys for the underlined characters. If the

<H2><FONT color="#20B2AA">Table Objects</FONT></H2>
<blockquote>
If the application permits, a user can change the width of a column in a table. When the
 pointer is over a column separator it changes to a two-headed horizontal arrow. Pressing
 the left mouse button causes a green outline to appear around the column to the left. As
 the pointer is moved, the right side of the outline moves and becomes white whenever it is
 not at the current separator position.  When the button is released, the column fills the
 outline and columns to the right of the one whose size was changed are moved accordingly.<P>
If the application permits, a user can move columns within a table. When the pointer is over
 a tableField or its title area, pressing <b>Meta-</b>left-mouse-button
 (<b>Alt-</b>left-mouse-button on IBM keyboards) causes the pointer to change to a
 two-headed horizontal arrow and the column to be covered by an image of the column and
 title area, with a yellow outline. As the pointer is moved, the image moves horizontally.
 When the button is released, the column is moved past any columns between the image and its
 original location, and the table variable is respecified accordingly. If the new location
 is the same as the old, no respecification of the table variable takes place. (Actually,
 you can use any mouse button for this operation and you can press <b>Control</b> at the
 same time if you are so inclined; indeed, you can press several mouse buttons
 simultaneously and the drop will take place when the last button is released.)

When the pointer is anywhere in the object:
<ul>
<li>Pressing <b>Home</b> moves the slider to the left or top and sets the value to min or
 max; pressing <b>End</b> moves the slider to the right or bottom and sets the value to max
 or min. (Because of the conflict between text conventions and axis and scale conventions,
 the same key changes the variable value oppositely in the horizontal and vertical cases.)<P>
<li>Pressing <b>Page Up</b> increases the value by an amount that is controlled by the
 application; the default is ten. Pressing <b>Page Down</b> decreases it by the same
 amount.<P>
<li>Pressing <b>up-arrow</b> or <b>right-arrow</b> increases the value by an amount that is
 controlled by the application;  the default is one.  (Either key works for both classes,
 horizontal and vertical.)  Pressing <b>down-arrow</b> or <b>left-arrow</b> decreases it by
 the same amount.  Holding an <b>arrow</b> key down causes its action to be rapidly repeated,

The <A NAME=62>scan-x feature enables detailed analysis of the trace data by displaying the numeric value of each trace point as the pointer is swept horizontally across the graph.  Pressing the middle button draws a vertical line at the pointer location, and displays a y-value for each trace in the legend window and an x-value in a box which appears at the other end of the pointer.  For high-low style traces, the legend window is further expanded to show component values.  The xy-values appear in the same format as the corresponding axis labels.<P>
As the line is moved across the screen, the displayed values change.  When the line intersects the traces, the x-value and y-values are updated in a discrete fashion; for each trace, a y-value is shown for the data point directly to the left of the line; the x-value that is displayed is the one that corresponds to the displayed y-values for the last trace set in the definition of the graph variable.  When the data for a trace gives values for x in an order that is not increasing, however, the trace is considered by s to be overlapping, and then the y-values are not shown and if it is the only trace the x-values vary continuously;  even if the values for x for the trace are respecified, it continues to be considered overlapping.<P>
When the pointer is in an area outside the range of the x-values, the displayed x-values vary continuously and y-values are not shown. If the legend is not shown when the middle mouse button is pressed, the scan-x box will be empty: it will not display x coordinates.
