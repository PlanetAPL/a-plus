1.  Introduction                                                      

In the Simple Arrays tutorial we concentrated on homogeneous arrays   
whose elements were integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or  
symbols.  The emphasis was on the items of an array, and how the      
concept of items, and more generally those of frames and cells,       
provide a unifying view of simple arrays for understanding the        
behavior of many primitive functions.  In this chapter - which builds 
on the Simple Arrays tutorial - we turn to nested, heterogeneous       
arrays, i.e.  arrays whose elements are other arrays or even function 
expressions.The primitive functions discussed in the Simple Arrays    
tutorial that select or rearrange their arguments apply to nested     
arrays as well as simple arrays; examples will be given.  In addition,
their are primitive functions, and one primitive operator, that are   
most meaningful when applied to nested arrays.  The more complex data 
structures that are possible with nested arrays provide alternative   
ways to approach many programming problems.                           

Experimentation is still the best way to learn, and so we begin again 
with methods of creating test data.                                   


2.  Creating Test Arrays                                              

The primitive functions and operators illustrated in this section are:
	Enclose: Monadic < 
	Each: Monadic operator denoted by ¡ that applies to monadic and
	dyadic functions                       

In addition, some syntax specific to the formation of nested arrays   
appears, called strand notation.                                      

As with simple arrays, it is helpful to know how to produce test data 
for heterogeneous, nested arrays.                                     

Examples                                                              

Execute each of the following:                                        

	<É3 5		ã A scalar holding the integer matrix É3 5, 
			ã   or what is called the enclose of É3 5Ó.

The Enclose primitive applies to any array and produces a nested      
scalar holding that array.                                            

	(10 32;'abc')	ã Strand notation for a 2-element vector whose 
			ã elements hold the vectors 10 32 and 'abc'.

Note the symbol < to the left of both 10 32 and 'abc' in the display  
of the result of this expression.  This symbol indicates that the     
array to the right of the symbol is enclosed within some other array. 

	((10 32;'abc');2 2Ò'ABCD')	ã Strand notation for a 2-element 
					ã vector whose first element holds 
					ã the nested vector (10 32;'abc'), 
					ã and whose second element holds 
					ã 2 2Ò'ABCD'.         

	2 2Ò(10.5 113.58;'abc';`xft3;É2 4) 	ã A 2x2 matrix consisting of a   
						ã floating-point vector, a 
						ã character vector, a symbol 
						ã scalar, and an integer matrix. 

All the vectors in these examples are created by strand notation.  In 
general, a strand is simply a list of expressions separated by        
semicolons, with the entire list surrounded by parentheses.           

Note that the display of the result of the last expression does not   
reflect its shape; the elements are simply listed one above the other 
in row major order.  A more effective display is produced the function
disp.lay in the script disp.a.  Execute the following to see these    
displays.                                                             

	$load disp                                                           
	disp.lay (10 32;'abc')                                               
	disp.lay 2 2Ò(10.5 113.58;'abc';`xft3;É2 4)                          

The tutorial will not explicitly refer to this display function again,
but you should feel free to use it to clarify results.                

	(?10Ò50;?15Ò32)			ã A 2-element vector consisting of 
					ã a vector of 10 random numbers 
					ã between 0 and 49,and a vector of 
					ã 15 random numbers between 0 and 31. 

	?¡(10Ò50;15Ò32)			ã The same result as above.  In this 
					ã case the each operator, denoted by 
					ã the dieresis, is applied to the 
					ã function ? and the vector (10Ò50;15Ò32).
					ã The effect of the operator is to apply
					ã the function to the contents of each 
					ã element of the vector.        

	É¡3 5 10 6		ã A 4-element vector whose elements hold, in 
				ã order, the vector É3, the vector É5,  
				ã the vector É10, and the vector É6. 

	10?¡15 20 25		ã A 3-element vector whose elements hold 10?15, 
				ã 10?20, and 10?25. 

	10 15?¡15 20		ã A 2-element vector whose elements hold 10?15 
				ã and 15?20. 

	10 15?¡25		ã A 2-element vector whose elements hold 10?25 
				ã and 15?25.    

	<@1 É5 7		ã A 5-element vector whose elements hold the 
				ã 7-element vectors that make up the rows of É5 7.


3.  Characteristics of Nested Arrays                                  

The primitive functions and operators illustrated in this section are:
	Shape: Monadic Ò                                                     
	Indexing: [;É;]                                                      
	Count and Choose: Monadic and Dyadic #                               
	Type: Monadic ©                                                      
	Depth: Monadic ½                                                     
	Apply: Monadic operator denoted by ¡ that applies to function scalars

The purpose of this section, as in the Simple Arrays tutorial, is to  
illustrate the A+ primitives that deal with these most basic          
properties of arrays:                                                 

    shape, e.g.  the number of rows and columns of a matrix;          

    reshaping an array to a specified shape;                          

    count, e.g.  the number of rows of a matrix;                      

    type,  that is, whether the elements are characters, integers, etc.;  

    depth, that is, the levels of nesting;                            

    selection of elements and subarrays.                              

Nesting adds a new aspect to arrays, namely, that elements of arrays  
do not have to be individual values, but can hold other arrays.       
Whether or not an array is nested has no effect on the basic functions
for determining count and shape, for reshaping, and for selecting     
elements or subarrays, because the definitions of these functions do  
not depend on the contents of elements.  For example, the vector      

	vû('abc';É5 2;`as_de;12 34 891)                                      

has four elements and so its count is the scalar 4 and its shape is   
the one-element vector 1Ò4, just as the count of the four-element     
vector 3 14 21 ¢5 is the scalar 4 and its shape is the one-element    
vector 1Ò4:                                                           

	#v                                                                   
 4                                                                    
	Òv                                                                   
 4                                                                    

Analogously, elements of nested arrays can be rearranged with Reshape 
and selected with Indexing and Choose, just like the elements of      
simple arrays:                                                        

	aû2 2Òv                                                              

For example, both a[0;1] and (0;1)#a equal the element at the         
intersection of the first row and second column, regardless of whether
that element is nested or not.  As in the simple array case, this     
element is a scalar; Indexing and Choose have not selected the array  
inside the element, namely É5 2, but the element that holds that      
array:                                                                

	a[0;1]                                                               
< 0 1 2 3 4 			ã The leading < indicates nesting. 
  5 6 7 8 9                                                           
	(0;1)#a                                                              
< 0 1 2 3 4                                                           
  5 6 7 8 9                                                           
	Ò(0;1)#a                                                             
			ã Only a new line occurs, indicating an empty result. 

The Type primitive, denoted by monadic ©, applies to nested arrays and
returns `box as their type, as in:                                    

	©a                                                                   
 `box                                                                 
	©(0;1)#a		ã The selected element is also boxed.
 `box                                                                 

However, the situation is more complicated than this example          
indicates, and is discussed in the section that follows (3a1.  Type). 

The new primitive introduced in this section is Depth, denoted by     
monadic ½.  The purpose of this primitive is to serve an analogous    
role to the Shape primitive, measuring the level of nesting in an     
array instead of the lengths of axes.  In particular, the depth of any
simple array of type `int, `float, or `char, is 0.  For example:      

	½1 2 3 4                                    
 0                                                                    
	½'abcdef'                                   
 0                                                                    
	½a		ã At least one nested element 1 level down.  
 1                                                                    

As with the Type primitive, we will return to the Depth primitive in  
the next section (3a2.  Depth).                                       


3a.  Nested Arrays, Function Arrays and Symbol Arrays                 

A symbol is a string of alphabetic characters, underscores (_), and   
dots (.) that is represented as a single scalar, just as an integer is
a single scalar representing a string of digits.  A symbol constant   
consists of a backquote (`) followed by a string of characters.  For  
example, just as 1 2.34 12e3 is a list of three numbers, `a.s `12 `w_3
is a list of three symbols.                                           

A function scalar is a scalar array holding a function (not the name  
of the function, but the function itself).  A constant symbol scalar  
consists of the symbols <{, followed by a function, followed by the   
symbol }.  For example, <{+/} is a function scalar holding +          
Reduction.  The sole purpose of the Apply operator is to evaluate     
function scalars.  For example:                                       

	(<{+/})¡3 4 5 6 7                                                    

Symbol arrays and function arrays are arrays whose elements are all   
symbols or all function scalars, respectively.                        


3a1.  Type                                                            

Function arrays, symbol arrays, and nested arrays are actually all    
variations of the same internal representation, and thereby can be    
combined freely to form other arrays.  For example, the following     
expressions are valid:                                                

	`abc,<É5 2  
	(<2 3Ò'abcdef'),<{+}                 
	(<{«/}),`times_reduction                  

On the other hand, the primitive function Type distinguishes between  
symbol, function, and nested arrays, as in the following examples:    

	©`abc                                         
	©<{«/}                                    
	©<'abc'                             

Consequently, one might say that arrays whose elements hold objects of
more than one type are of mixed type, as in the case of the three     
examples above.  Le's see what the type function returns when applied
to them:                                                              

	©`abc,<É5 2  
	©(2 3Ò'abcdef';+)                        
	©(«/;`times_reduction)                           
As you can see, there is no array type called `mixed.  Instead, the   
type rule is as follows:                                              

	The type of a non-empty array is the type of the first element of its
	ravel.                                                                

For example, reverse each of the arrays in the above examples to get a
new first element and apply the Type primitive again:                 

	©÷`abc,<É5 2                                                         
	©÷(2 3Ò'abcdef'),<{+}                                                
	©÷(<{«/},`times_reduction                                            

There is a fourth player among the mixed arrays, the Null, which is   
denoted by ().  The Null is the only empty vector to which any        
elements of type `box, `func, or `sym can be concatenated.  It has its
own type, which is `null.  For example:                               

	©()                                                                  
	©(),`abc                                                             
	©(),<{ ,«}                                                           
	©(),<É10                                                             
	©(;É10)                                                              

All empty nested arrays are of type `null.  For example:              

	aûÉ¡2 2Ò5 15 10 20 	ã A four-element vector of integer vectors.   
	Ò0 0/a	                                                              
 0 2                                                                  
	©0 0/a                                                               
 `null                                                                
	Ò2Õ@1 a                                                              
 2 0                                                                  
	©2Õ@1 a                                                              
 `null                                                                

Ex 1 What is the difference, if any, between `abc,<É3 4 and (`abc;É3 4)?


3a2.  Depth                                                           

In the previous section we saw that arrays of four different types can
be combined to form other arrays.  Depth reflects the level of nesting
in arrays, and as such does not have the same value for scalars of    
these four types.  For example:                                       

	½`abc                                                                
	½<{+.«}                                                              
	½<É10 4                                                              
	½<<É10 4                                                             
	½()                                                                  

Ex 2 Here are the rules for the Depth primitive:                      

    the depth of a scalar of type other than `box is 0;               
    the depth of an empty array of type other than `null is 0;        
    every level of enclosure in a scalar increases the depth of the scalar
      by 1;                                                                 
    the depth of an array is the maximum depth of its (scalar) elements.  

Write a defined function that is equivalent to the Depth primitive.   

Ex 3 We tend to use the terms symbol array for those arrays whose     
elements are all symbols, and function array for those arrays whose   
elements all hold function expressions, much in the same way as we use
integer array, floating-point array, or character array.  The latter  
three are easily defined, namely, as arrays of type `int, `float,     
`char, respectively.  However, even if the type of an array is `sym,  
the array is not necessarily a symbol array; e.g., (`a;3).  And       
similarly for function arrays.  Each of the following expressions     
attempts to test whether or not an array is a symbol array, or a      
function array.  Which are successful, and for any that are not, why  
not?                                                                  

	a is a symbol array if (`sym=a)^0=½a                                 
	x is a function array if ~0Å`func=©@0 x                              
	xy is a symbol array if 0=0Ødo Îxy                                   
	z is a function array if ~0Å(<`func)=©¡z                             


3b.  General Purpose Primitive Functions and Nested Arrays            

Among the primitive functions discussed in the Simple Arrays tutorial 
are those that select and rearrange items and elements of their       
arguments.  These functions generally apply to simple arrays of any   
type.  It turns out that they apply to nested arrays as well, and in  
the expected manner; the definitions of these functions for selecting 
and rearranging items and elements do not depend in any way on the    
contents of those elements and items.  We have already examples of    
this above, namely, Indexing and Choose.                              

For example, the Take primitive applies to nested right arguments as  
well as simple ones:                                                  

	2Ù`xyz,('abcd';É4 2),<{+}                                            
<  xyz                                                                
< abcd                                                                


4.  Constructing Nested Elements and Extracting their Contents        

The primitive functions illustrated in this section are:              
	Enclose: Monadic <                                                   
	Disclose: Monadic >                                                  
	Pick: Monadic Ø                                                      

The basic building block for nested arrays is the Enclose primitive,   
denoted by monadic <.  The Enclose primitive applies to any array and 
produces a scalar holding that array; the depth of the scalar result  
is 1 plus the depth of the argument, and the type of the result is    
always `box.                                                          

	<'abcde'                                                             
< abcde                                                               
	Ò<'abcde'                                                            
			ã Only a new line occurs, indicating an empty result. 
	½'abcde'                                                             
 0                                                                    
	½<'abcde'                                                            
 1                                                                    
	½<<'abcde'                                                           
 2                                                                    

The Disclose primitive, denoted by monadic >, is a left inverse of    
Enclose, in that the Disclose of the Enclose of any array equals that 
array, unless that array was a function: the depth of a function is   
-1, and the minimum depth of the result of Disclose is 0.             

	><'abcde'                                                            
 abcde                                                                
	'abcde'½><'abcde'                                                    
 1                                                                    

Disclose is also permissive, in that applies to scalars of depth 0,   
i.e.  scalars that are not a result of Enclose.                       

	>3                                                                   
 3                                                                    
	3=>3                                                                 
 1                                                                    

Disclose also applies to arrays with more than one element, as long   
the all the disclosed elements have the same shape:                   

	>(1 2 3 4; 60 70 80 90)                                              
  1  2  3  4                                                          
 60 70 80 90                                                          

In its simplest form, the Pick primitive, denoted by dyadic Ø, is     
Choose followed by Disclose:                                          

	1Ø('xcty';`xy_w;É5 7)                                                
 `xy_w                                                                
	>1#('xcty';`xy_w;É5 7)                                               
 `xy_w                                                                
	`xy_w½1Ø('xcty';`xy_w;É5 7)                                          
 1                                                                    
	2Ø('abc';É5 2;`as_de;12 34 891)                                      
 `as_de                                                               
	>2#('abc';É5 2;`as_de;12 34 891)                                     
 `as_de                                                               

The left argument to Pick can also be a path vector that reaches as   
deep into the right argument as its length.  For example:             

	0 1Ø(('abcd';3 4 1);`xyz)                                            
 3 4 1                                                                

Ex 4 In the above examples the left arguments to Pick are composed of 
index expressions for the various levels of the corresponding right   
arguments.  Note the order of these index expressions in the left     
arguments.  Namely, if the left argument x is a vector with more than 
one element, and is a valid path vector for the right argument w, then
xØs equals (1Õx)Ø(1Ùx)Øw.                                             

    Test this relation for the appropriate examples above;            

What are the conditions on x and the scalar n so that xØw equals      
(nÕx)Ø(nÙx)Øw.                                                        


4a.  Slot-Filler Arrays                                               

Slot-filler arrays are two-element nested vectors that satisfy certain
requirements and that, in return, are treated specially by the Pick   
primitive and screen display functions.  Specifically, an array s is a
slot-filler array if the following conditions are met:                

    s is a two-element vector;                                        

both 0Øs and 1Øs are vectors or both are scalars, and they have the   
same number of elements;                                              

    all the elements of 0Øs are symbols;                              
    the depth of 1Øs is at least 1.                                   

For example, the following are slot-filler arrays:                    

	(`a`b`c;(10;20;30))                                                  
	(`w`xx`yyy`zzzz;(;É5 3;'abcdef';(`astd;3 4 5 1)))                    
	(`qw;<10?20)                                                         

The following are not:                                                

	(`a`b;(10;30;30))                                                    
	(`x`y`zz;2 3 4)                                                      

Ex 5 Define a monadic function that returns 1 if its argument is a    
slot-filler array and 0 otherwise.  Test your function on a variety of
examples, and compare the results with those of the system function   
_issf.                                                                

From the viewpoint of the Pick primitive, slot-filler arrays are      
key-value pairs.  That is, if s denotes a slot-filler array, a symbol 
in 0Øs can be used as the left argument to Pick, with s the right     
argument, and the result is the contents of the corresponding element 
of 1Øs.  For example:                                                 

	`aØ(`a`b`c;(10;20;30))                                               
 10                                                                   
	`bØ(`a`b`c;(10;20;30))                                               
 20                                                                   

Ex 6 If s is a slot-filler array and x is a symbol that appears in    
0Øs, then xØs equals ((0Øs)Éx)Ø1Øs.  Is this definition of xØs        
correct? If not, correct it.                                          

A nested slot-filler array is one whose values in the key-value pairs 
may be also slot-filler arrays themselves, or even nested slot-filler 
arrays.  For example, the following is a nested slot-filler array:   

	sû(`a`b`c;(10;(`x`y;(100;200));(`e`f;((`g`h;(1000;2000));'A+'))))    

when the right argument to Pick is a nested slot-filler array, the    
right argument can be a vector of symbols reaching into the right     
argument to extract a value.  For example, evaluate each of the       
following:                                                            

	`aØs                                                                 
	`b`xØs                                                               
	`bØs		ã There is no need to Pick all the way to the bottom.
	`c`fØs                                                               
	`c`e`gØs                                                             

The symbol scalar or vector on the left of Pick is called a path to   
the slot-filler array on the right.                                   

Ex 7 Repeat Ex 4 for nested slot-fillers.  Note the order of the      
symbols in the left argument to Pick in the above examples.  Namely,  
if the left argument v is a vector with more than one element, and is 
a valid path vector to the nested slot-filler array s, then vØs equals
(1Õv)Ø(1Ùv)Øs.                                                        

    Test this relation for the appropriate examples above;            

What are the conditions on v and the scalar n so that vØs equals      
(nÕv)Ø(nÙv)Øs.                                                        


5.  Primitive Functions and Operators Specifically for Nested Arrays  

Some of the primitive functions discussed in the Simple Arrays        
tutorial apply to nested arrays, while others are restricted to simple
arrays - in particular, those that are further restricted to numeric  
arrays.  There are also primitives that are specific to nested arrays,
in that their arguments, or results, or both, must be nested arrays.  
It is these primitives that are discussed in this section.            


5a.  Partition, Partition Count, and the Each Operator                

The primitives illustrated in this section are useful for partitioning
arrays into sections.  For example, suppose we want to break the      
following sentence into words:                                        

	sû"Partition Count is a dyadic function, while Partition is monadic." 

 We begin by identifying the word breaks, namely the blanks:          

	bûs=' '                                                              
	b                                                                    
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0           

The Partition Count primitive applies to b and returns a vector whose 
length is the number of 1Õs in b, i.e.  +/b, and whose ith item is 1  
plus the length of the sequence of contiguous 0's following the ith 1.
The argument to Partition Count must start with a non-zero element.   
Since the sentence s does not have a leading blank, b does not have a 
leading 1, so we'll prefix a 1 to b:                                  

	Ú1,b                                                                 
 10 6 3 2 7 10 6 10 3 9                                               

Be sure to compare this result to the lengths of sequences of 0's in  
b.  The Partition function will break the sentence s up into parts    
(words, hopefully) based on the last result.                          

 	(Ú1,b)Ús                                                            
< Partition                                                           
< Count                                                               
< is                                                                  
< a                                                                   
< dyadic                                                              
< function,                                                           
< while                                                               
< Partition                                                           
< is                                                                  
< monadic.                                                            

As you can see, we have a nested vector of character vectors, which   
are (almost) words.  Nested arrays are very useful here, because the  
character vectors are of different lengths.  Let's check the lengths  
of words by applying the Count primitive to each element of the result
(by way of the Each operator):                                        

	wû(Ú1,b)Ús                                                           
	>#¡w                                                                 
 10 6 3 2 7 10 6 10 3 8                                               

Note that these values agree with the elements in Ú1,b (there is no   
trailing blank on the last item).  Each character vector has at least 
one unwanted character.  For example, the first character vector holds
the word "Partition", but the vector has 10 characters and the word   
has only 9.  We can check that the extraneous characters are not on   
the front of the words by looking at the first character of each one: 

	1Ù¡w                                                                 
< P                                                                   
< C                                                                   
< i                                                                   
< a                                                                   
< d                                                                   
< f                                                                   
< w                                                                   
< P                                                                   
< i                                                                   
< m                                                                   

So, the extraneous characters are on the ends of the words.  We will  
continue this example in the exercises.                               

Ex 8 Use the Drop primitive and the Each operator to remove one       
character from the end of each word.  Which of the resulting character
vectors still contain extraneous characters? Suggest ways to get rid  
of all extraneous characters at once.                                 

Ex 9 Insert an extra space between two words in the sentence s, and   
call the new sentence s0.  For example:                               

	s0û"Partition Count  is a dyadic function, while Partition is monadic."

Partition s0:                                                         

	w0û(Ú1,s0=' ')Ús0                                                    

Examine w0, and explain how the extra blank in s is manifested in w0. 
How would you remove it from the w0?                                  

Ex 10 Partition the vector s0 of Ex 9 as follows:                     

	w1û(Ú1,s0Å' ,.')Ús0                                                  

Examine w1, and explain how the punctuation characters, as well as the
extra blank, are manifested in w1.  How would you remove these        
characters from w1?                                                   

Ex 11 Suppose the leading character is a blank, i.e.  form            

	s1û' ',s                                                             

Describe the result of                                                

	w2û(Ú1,s1Å' ,.')Ús1                                                  

Ex 12 How would you define a function to partition a sentence into    
words, when the punctuation characters can be commas, periods, and    
semicolons, and when there can be multiple blanks between words, and  
zero or mare blanks at the beginning and end of the sentence?         


5b.  Raze and Rake                                                    

The primitives Raze and Rake apply to nested arrays and bring all     
elements up level 0 and 1, respectively.
