- fixed _items{} to ignore the file-size check so it can repair files
  that have inadvertently been truncated or have invalid items set.
- new system function _memStats{}
- new system variable, `beamMSyncMode.  This variable controls if and
  how msync() is called when a variable "beamed" read/write is updated.
   Valid settings
      `none        -msync() is not called
      `MS_ASYNC    -specifies that an update be scheduled, but the
                    call returns immediately.
      `MS_SYNC     -asks for an update and waits for it to complete
                    (THIS SETTING IS VERY SLOW!!)*
   The default settings are:
       Linux       `MS_ASYNC
       Solaris     `none
       IRIX (SGI)  `MS_ASYNC
- new invocation options
    -c Enables core file creation
    -m ws_mem_stats  (same as _memStats{`on}
	
- new system function, _msyncAll{ flag } where flag can be `MS_ASYNC
  or `MS_SYNC.  Internally this functions iterates over the all the
  beamed files mmapped Read/Write and performs a msync() with the
  flag specified.
